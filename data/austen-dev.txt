" There , papa !-- Now you must be satisfied -- Our own dear Mrs . Weston , who is carefulness itself .
I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court - plaister , one of the very last times we ever met in it !-- It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat -- just before Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley came -- I think the very evening .-- Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife , and your recommending court - plaister ?-- But , as you had none about you , and knew I had , you desired me to supply him ; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece ; but it was a great deal too large , and he cut it smaller , and kept playing some time with what was left , before he gave it back to me .
The motive was too common to be wondered at ; but the means , however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in ill - breeding , were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife .
" Depend upon it , Elton will not do .
People of the name of Tupman , very lately settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families .
" Yes , that of course ."
so do I ."
Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can .
What I said just now , meant nothing .
Come , what is your competence ?"
That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma ' s brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled .
There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her .
" But at least , Mamma , you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured .
A larger society would improve them .
" Nothing remarkable .
What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts ?-- It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _one_ exception ."
Another slice of cold meat , another draught of Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us ."
Here he stopped to be thanked ; which being done , he went on .
Her husband , but with great humility , did not see the force of her objection .
It may be only the hair of some great uncle of HIS ."
She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary ' s wrong , as Mr . Knightley .
They arrived .-- Mrs .
She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot .
He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected .
When had his influence , such influence begun ?-- When had he succeeded to that place in her affection , which Frank Churchill had once , for a short period , occupied ?-- She looked back ; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter ' s becoming known to her -- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it -- oh !
Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth .
How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs . Smith , when I next came into the country , would be that Barton cottage was taken : and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it , can account for .
screamed Mary , catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment , Henrietta , sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for Captain Benwick and Anne , who caught and supported her between them .
What is it ?"
She longed to see the Crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them .
When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music !
We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us .
Hardly fit for service then .
CHAPTER 3
My father depends on it .
A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands .
There was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same .
It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen ' s saffron robe would be put on for us .
there is nothing in THAT .
The answer was only in this short note :
Mr . Knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of Mr . Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella ' s first day .
" Have you finished your letter ?"
" The first news that reached me of her ," he continued , " came in a letter from herself , last October .
I suppose " ( smiling ) " I have more pride than any of you ; but I confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them ."
" Upon my word ," said Mr . Dashwood , " I believe you are perfectly right .
Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation .
Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her , no landed estate , no headship of a family ; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet , she would not change situations with Anne .
" Shall I ring the bell ?"
After sitting with them a few minutes , the Miss Steeles returned to the Park , and Elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched .
To her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind .
I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees .
Elinor , though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon , could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away , which Mrs . Jennings was desirous of her feeling ; for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation , her wonder was otherwise disposed of .
I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to - day ."
High hills rose immediately behind , and at no great distance on each side ; some of which were open downs , the others cultivated and woody .
Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves !
After her entrance , Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before , and Mrs . Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long .
He had no pleasure at Norland ; he detested being in town ; but either to Norland or London , he must go .
It was a perpetual estrangement .
" There it is .
" Oh !
" Oh !
Mr . Weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already .
Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed .
I really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out .
Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel !
Compliments , charades , and horrible blunders ; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too ; but she behaved very well , and was only rather pale and silent .
In the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings ' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of Mrs . Churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of Mrs . Weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it .
I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before ."
Elinor attempted no more .
Her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot .
He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard .
The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year , and his brother left everything sadly involved .
He listened to her with silent attention , and on her ceasing to speak , rose directly from his seat , and after saying in a voice of emotion , " to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her ,"-- took leave , and went away .
I call it a very fine country -- the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug -- with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there .
I am perfectly comfortable to - day ."
There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth ' s face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced Anne , that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove ' s kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self - amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent ' s feelings .
The names which occasionally dropt of former associates , the allusions to former practices and pursuits , suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been .
for himself .
She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever were .
Should he ever propose to me ( which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ), I shall not accept him .
The house belonged to people in business .
He could not forgive her , but he could not be unfeeling .
" He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy ," said the Admiral ; " but there is no saying which .
His appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not now .
She saw that there had been bad habits ; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ?
But SOMETIMES they are ."
He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late .
She had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading .
At ten years old , she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen .
" DEAR SIR ,
Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods .
Their two confidential friends , Mr Shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and Lady Russell , were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride .
In this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon .
Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me , and we were so crowded !
Mr . Knightley ' s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _Dixon_ .
He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax ' s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him ;-- and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr . Knightley .
How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution , however , how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred , in what manner he expressed himself , and how he was received , need not be particularly told .
What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit ,-- espionage , and treachery ?-- To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all !-- Here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear .-- They must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable !"
" I suppose you know , ma ' am , that Mr . Ferrars is married ."
Look at my shoes .
All the rest , in speculation at least , was perfectly smooth .
In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but " dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing ."
" I have heard it asserted ," said John Knightley , " that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough .
But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be ."
Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board ."
" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here .
Mary deplored the necessity for herself .
I ' ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did .
Should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ?"
My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection .-- Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already .-- But hush !-- not a word , if you please ."
To Highbury in general it brought no material change .
How came they acquainted ?"
There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is .
At any rate I shall expect you to - morrow .
Her Christian name : I always forget her Christian name ."
He is the curate of the parish I dare say ."
I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me --( do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse ?)
" Will Mr . Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford ?"
" Mamma , you are not doing me justice .
What would you do yourself ?"
" I know it is "-- replied her mother seriously , " or after such a warning , I should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it .
-- You always called me , ` Mr . Knightley ;' and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound .-- And yet it is formal .
She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House , where , as she afterwards learnt , they must inevitably have found him , when they were stopped by the eldest boy ' s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall .
Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his back towards them .
" But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened .
Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account .
He held out his hand .
Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis , who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room .
I have not always known their writing apart ."
Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls .
" Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby ."
If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to Mr . Pratt ' s , all this would have been prevented .'
In half a minute they were in the room .
He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect .
It was growing quite dusk , however , before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross , and there had been total silence among them for some time , Henrietta leaning back in the corner , with a shawl over her face , giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep ; when , as they were going up their last hill , Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth .
Do help me .
Mrs . Weston ' s friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to Emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl .
" Four o ' clock !-- depend upon it he will be here by three ," was Mr . Weston ' s quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting .
said he to Emma , and trying , as he spoke , to catch Miss Fairfax ' s eye .
" I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs . Ferrars had took a dislike to me .
Emma saw how Mr . Weston understood these joyous prospects .
" Her sufferings have been very severe .
Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ?"
By whom can you have heard it mentioned ?"
She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease , this opposition was to yield ,-- when Mrs . Ferrars would be reformed , and her son be at liberty to be happy .
His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; Mrs . Churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to Randalls again .
She could soon tell at what coachmaker ' s the new carriage was building , by what painter Mr . Willoughby ' s portrait was drawn , and at what warehouse Miss Grey ' s clothes might be seen .
" I had a few lines on parish business from Mr . Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened ."
The day at Lyme , the fall from the Cobb , might influence her health , her nerves , her courage , her character to the end of her life , as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate .
Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever .
Mr . Perry had been to Mrs . Goddard ' s to attend a sick child , and Miss Nash had seen him , and he had told Miss Nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park , he had met Mr . Elton , and found to his great surprize , that Mr . Elton was actually on his road to London , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist - club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and Mr . Perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; Mr . Elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious .
Oh !
Had not Mrs . Weston any letter about her to produce ?"
what do you mean ?"
" I had not the smallest intention of asking him ," said Elizabeth , with affected carelessness , " but he gave so many hints ; so Mrs Clay says , at least ."
So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost !
Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect ."
If ever there were people who , without having great wealth themselves , had every thing they could wish for , I am sure it is us .
He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight .-- Oh !
Only think of those sweet verses --` To Miss --------.'
The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments .
-- cried Marianne again .--" So calm !-- so cheerful !-- how have you been supported ?"
Harriet was to be there in the evening , and the Bateses .
Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman ' s family , and mentioned a place ; and Anne , after the little pause which followed , added --
" Low , I am afraid , sir , very low ," answered his son ;--" but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way ."
I met _one_ as I came -- Madness in such weather !-- absolute madness !"
Mrs . Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness , had not Elinor , who really wished to hear her sister ' s unbiased opinion , by an eager sign , engaged her silence .
Charles , Anne , must not it ?
It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet ' s fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies .
oh !
This was all sent with the instrument .
And the dried cherries too !
Mrs . John Knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible .
Surry is full of beauties ."
" I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire .
" As moderate as those of the rest of the world , I believe .
And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her .
Such behaviour as this , so exactly the reverse of her own , appeared no more meritorious to Marianne , than her own had seemed faulty to her .
" Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success .
--
" Very beautiful , indeed ," replied Emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out ,
Marianne , I dare say , will not leave her room again this evening .
Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years !
It seems , on the contrary , to have been a perfectly spontaneous , untaught feeling on his side , and this surprises me .
You saw what she said .
A week to - morrow !-- And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself .
what can you possibly have to do ?"
" Well , mother , I have done something for you that you will like .
Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings ;-- she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others ;-- represented it , therefore , as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother , whom she so much wished to see , in a more eligible , more comfortable manner , than any other plan could do , and perhaps without any greater delay .
I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau ."
" That I am sure you would .
Mr . Knightley is coming too .
Emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs . Goddard ' s experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject ,
She could only resolve to avoid such self - delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell .
I managed it extremely well ."
Two such she did not want .
She looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion .
My beau , indeed !
Why does not he try Bath ?-- Indeed he should .
Ah !
" How do you do , Mrs . Ford ?
Sir Walter , Elizabeth and Mrs Clay , returned one morning from Laura Place , with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening , and Anne was already engaged , to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings .
The gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill .
" Oh !
Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ?
and to see you in such excellent looks !-- I would not have missed this meeting for the world .
_We_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient .-- I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _more_ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it .
And so saying , she took the screens out of her sister - in - law ' s hands , to admire them herself as they ought to be admired .
and Elizabeth , to do her justice , had , in the first ardour of female alarm , set seriously to think what could be done , and had finally proposed these two branches of economy , to cut off some unnecessary charities , and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing - room ; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne , as had been the usual yearly custom .
" You had better leave me ," was all the notice that her sister received from her .
The contrast between Mrs . Churchill ' s importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax ' s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman ' s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates ' s saying ,
A little disordered always the first twenty - four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards .
What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him !-- Assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax ' s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour ,-- equality of situation -- I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one -- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants .-- A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _her_ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals .-- Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune .
I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin ' s sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever ,) to get acquainted with her .
Emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you .
continued Lucy , after wiping her eyes , " I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely ."
It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation , for a change is not very probable there .
you will think very differently , when you are married .'
When she could give another glance , he had moved away .
Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr . Elton as he stood before them , could impair .-- Perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr . Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself .-- Robert Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married .
She could not think that Harriet ' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- " Mr . Elton is so good to the poor !"
It was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple .
" Emma , my dear Emma --"
Had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought !-- Had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong -- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been .
" Mermaids and sharks !
Emma seriously hoped she would .
I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella .
She was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives .
At length she replied :
Henrietta asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ` You were so altered he should not have known you again .'"
" Me !
And very nice young ladies they both are ; I hardly know one from the other ."
If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is Mrs . Stokes to be trusted ?
I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma .
I believe I have lived as much on board as most women , and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man - of - war .
" You had better order the carriage directly , my love ," said she ; " I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk .
While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr . Knightley by her side .
I think differently now ; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions ; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing .
" Never , madam ," cried he , affronted in his turn : " never , I assure you .
She felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be .
At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ' s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr . Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery ,
you would rather talk of her person than her mind , would you ?
I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life ."
Campbell ."
As soon as they returned to the carriage , Mrs . Jennings was eager for information ; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained , she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars , as she felt assured that Lucy , for the sake of her own consequence , would choose to have known .
And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life , and I wish you joy of it with all my heart ."
This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when .
Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr . Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , " that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr . Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr . Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness ."
For their own comfort they would much rather have remained , at least all the morning , in Mrs . Jennings ' s house ; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody .
" We shall never agree about him ," cried Emma ; " but that is nothing extraordinary .
He will be able to tell her how we all are ."
And yet , a few minutes afterwards , she felt as if their being in company with each other , under their present circumstances , could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind .
Before he could return to his chair , it was taken by Mrs . Weston .
How could he answer it to himself to rob his child , and his only child too , of so large a sum ?
Their attention was called towards the others .
I think very well of Mr . Elton , and this is the only way I have of doing him a service ."
" You speak very properly .
The usual character of them has nothing for me .
Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain -- but extremely elegant and amiable ."
An admiral speaks his own consequence , and , at the same time , can never make a baronet look small .
" You are right .
" Oh , yes , I dare say you will ."
It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other .
One morning , about a week after his leaving the country , Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk , instead of wandering away by herself .
There is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in Mr . Weston , which every body likes in _him_ , because there is so much good - humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied .
Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so .
Her own behaviour had been so very improper !
You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave .
Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half , of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection , had been rash and unjustifiable .
Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment .
The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable ;-- but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin .
To be constantly living with an ill - tempered person , must be dreadful .
you answer as discreetly as she could do herself .
" I am sorry we cannot see your sister , Miss Dashwood ," said Miss Steele .
" Yes , all of us ; Mrs . Elton would have us come .
" And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been ?-- how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her !-- Who is she ?-- Who can she be ?-- Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance ?-- Oh !
The sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; I have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth .
" I am quite sure ," he replied , speaking very distinctly , " that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so .
Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room .
But Marianne , in her place , would not have done so little .
I have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal ."
I cannot keep my eyes from it .
" I am most happy to hear it -- but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior !-- and exactly Emma ' s age ."
A man who had been in motion since eight o ' clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone !-- Such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world !-- Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party .
But now it is all too late .
" Is she still in town ?"
In Mrs . Dashwood ' s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne ' s ; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity , in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister , of saying too much what he thought on every occasion , without attention to persons or circumstances .
He looked at them slightly , without seeming to know who they were , and merely nodded to Mrs . Jennings from the other side of the room .
Many vain solicitudes would be prevented -- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it .
It was , indeed , a highly prized letter .
" Reserved !-- how , in what manner ?
I have no notion of people ' s making such a to - do about money and greatness .
This was a subject which ensured Marianne ' s attention , and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes , and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him , when Edward interrupted her by saying , " You must not enquire too far , Marianne -- remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars .
You made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said ."
Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers .
Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr . Frank Churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making Harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles .
It could be protracted no longer .
She could not stay .
" What , indeed , ma ' am !
Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration .
They had been once more in the same room .
She was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers .
Her early impressions were incurable .
Edward , it is so , and I will say it .
" No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that .
Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby .
yes , I am quite aware of that .
She would be never led into temptation , nor left for it to find her out .
He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .
Knightley ' s .-- Alas !
Emma was sorry ;-- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months !-- to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought !
She had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination .
After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with ,
There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot .
" I know it all , I know it all ," cried Mrs Smith .
I wished for him again the next summer , when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean ."
Her father ' s business was to announce James ' s being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing .
But not a bit did Walter stir .
I have quite a horror of upstarts .
How attentive she is , to think of every body !-- Thank you , my dear , for shewing it me .
" Part of my lace is gone ," said she , " and I do not know how I am to contrive .
He continued ,
She was so surprized she did not know what to do .
Her attention was now claimed by Mr . Woodhouse , who being , according to his custom on such occasions , making the circle of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to the ladies , was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity , said ,
They appear to so much advantage in company with each other .
How much worse , had they been obliged to meet !
There he had not always the patience that could have been wished .
_Her_ connexions may be worse than _his_ .
" You are a good woman ," he warmly replied .
" Did she know ?-- had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls ?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably ."
The ladies had not been long in the drawing - room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived .
Mrs . Jennings , knowing nothing of any change in the patient , went unusually early to bed ; her maid , who was one of the principal nurses , was recreating herself in the housekeeper ' s room , and Elinor remained alone with Marianne .
She could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for Perry too often .
Even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it .
" If you please , my dear .
Mr . Elton and I are very good friends , and nothing more ;" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel .
And with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent .
Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card .
Lady Elliott wished to give a dance .
" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates .-- He really is engaged from morning to night .-- There is no end of people ' s coming to him , on some pretence or other .-- The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion .
Design could never bring them in each other ' s way : negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise ; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton , where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage , which Mrs . Dashwood , from foreseeing at first as a probable event , had brought herself to expect as a certain one .
To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show Mrs . John Dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match .
" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate ,-- that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends .
( End of volume one .)
Is she angry ?"
I ' d rather you would ."
" I cannot think there is any danger of it ," was Emma ' s calm answer -- " and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax ' s situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown ."
Mr . Elton , I must beg leave to stop at your house , and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string , or any thing just to keep my boot on ."
Elinor saw , and pitied her for , the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable ; but she saw , with less tenderness of feeling , the thorough want of delicacy , of rectitude , and integrity of mind , which her attentions , her assiduities , her flatteries at the Park betrayed ; and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance ; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality , and whose conduct toward others made every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless .
She must be collected and calm .
He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms .
Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies .
There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies , and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower , and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight , excepting Louisa ; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth .
there he is .
" Mary is good - natured enough in many respects ," said she ; " but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the Elliot pride .
The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of , and the usual observations made .
I owed it to her , therefore , to avoid giving any hint of the truth ; and I owed it to my family and friends , not to create in them a solicitude about me , which it could not be in my power to satisfy ."
We live at home , quiet , confined , and our feelings prey upon us .
This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before .
It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him .
She tried to dissuade Mary from going , but in vain ; and that being the case , thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves ' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise , as she might be useful in turning back with her sister , and lessening the interference in any plan of their own .
Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion .
" Oh !
My Elinor , is it possible to doubt their engagement ?
" Did you see her often at Weymouth ?
Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own !
With such a knowledge as this , it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject .
" Well -- if you please ," said Mrs . Weston rather hesitating , " if you think she will be of any use ."
The event was more favourable to Mr . Woodhouse than to Emma .
She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware .
" I have not a doubt of it ," said Marianne ; " and I have nothing to regret -- nothing but my own folly ."
To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be ."
my dear sir , how are you this morning ?
" And you must be off this very morning ?"
Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence .
Against the interest of her own individual comfort , Mrs . Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where , at that time , than at Barton , where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner , by constantly placing Willoughby before her , such as she had always seen him there .
He walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both Mr . and Mrs . Weston .
I have a note of his .-- Do not you remember , Mrs . Weston , employing him to write for you one day ?"
Elinor tried to talk of something else ; but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes , from what was uppermost in her mind .
Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play , if Henrietta and all the others liked it , when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming --
Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ?
" No -- I have never seen Mr . Elton ," she replied , starting on this appeal ; " is he -- is he a tall man ?"
You know we have settled all that already .
Her heart was really grieved .
This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed .
What is Mr Elliot to me ?"
She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before .
She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet ' s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .
Not above ten miles , I dare say ."
my poor dear child , the truth is , that in London it is always a sickly season .
It will be some trial to us both ."
Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown .-- I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet ,
About a mile and a half from the cottage , along the narrow winding valley of Allenham , which issued from that of Barton , as formerly described , the girls had , in one of their earliest walks , discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which , by reminding them a little of Norland , interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it .
Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet ."
But sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts , very entertaining .
" Pretty well , ma ' am in the fifteen years of my marriage ; though many women have done more .
" Merely Gowland ," he supposed .
" She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me ," she continued --" like La Baronne d ' Almane on La Comtesse d ' Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ' Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan ."
Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible ."
" To be sure !"
She who had not been able to remain in Louisa ' s room , or to look at her , without sufferings which made her worse than helpless !
He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately , and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year ; at the same time , however , slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless , by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon ' s wife , and Marianne as THEIR visitor .
Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything ;-- Marianne ' s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby .-- His own merits must soon secure it ."
When one lives in the world , a man or woman ' s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought .
" The old lady !
Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax ; but it was most prudent to avoid speech .
Elinor smiled again , to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna .
He had met with them in a little perplexity , which must be laid before Emma .
She must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and Mr . Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs . Weston , best in the world .
" Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ?"
It was , indeed , so odd ; Harriet ' s behaviour was so extremely odd , that Emma did not know how to understand it .
Anne saw nothing , thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room .
The preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which Mr . John Knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent .
said she ; ' my dear Ferrars , do tell me how it is to be managed .
" I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend .
There was no occasion to press the matter farther .
Till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar - bone was soon replaced , and though Mr Robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew ' s state , as to give the information of Captain Wentworth ' s visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before .
She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself ; but this was no new sensation .
The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ' s sketch to wish to go on .
He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c ., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , Anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question .
Some letters had passed between her and her brother , in consequence of Marianne ' s illness ; and in the first of John ' s , there had been this sentence :-- " We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward , and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject , but conclude him to be still at Oxford ;" which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence , for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters .
Mrs Harville , a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of Captain Wentworth , or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them .
" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ?"
Always the first person to be thought of !
" I do not know .-- One of the Otways .-- Not Frank ;-- it is not Frank , I assure you .
Marianne , now looking dreadfully white , and unable to stand , sunk into her chair , and Elinor , expecting every moment to see her faint , tried to screen her from the observation of others , while reviving her with lavender water .
This is what I believe to have happened .
But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us ."
" You forget how much she belongs to Highbury .
" Jane Fairfax !-- Good God !
" You wrong her exceedingly .
Emma had never been to Box Hill ; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing , and she and Mr . Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither .
But she was not wanted to speak .
A few years before , Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height , her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ), there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem .
As they were turning into the grounds , Mr . Perry passed by on horseback .
I am no young lady on her preferment .
He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill ' s engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her .-- The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings .
She could not be deceived in that .
" If you are very kind ," said he , " it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night ;-- let me live them over again .
But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs . Elton , which nobody else pays her ."
She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were ; a letter from her son - in - law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February , and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother .
They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times .
cried Harriet , colouring , and astonished .
You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men .
When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement ."
" I must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU ; to assure him that he has made me a very -- an exceedingly happy man ."
Are not you astonished ?
he had never written , hardly ever , any thing of the kind in his life .
-- She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when Mrs . Jennings talked of Edward ' s affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat .-- Such advances towards heroism in her sister , made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself .
He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions .
Musgrove , take care of the others ."
In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings ; but one complete dinner engagement , and out of the house too , there was no avoiding , though at Christmas .
You know , Mrs . Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves .
But when you mentioned Mrs . Dixon , I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship .
Her way was clear , though not quite smooth .-- She spoke then , on being so entreated .-- What did she say ?-- Just what she ought , of course .
" I mean ,"-- said he , with serious energy --" if I can , to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW .
" It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ?"
I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours .
In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .
" About a fortnight .
We never were so long without seeing her before , and as I was telling Mrs . Cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now ."
no .
I mean to offer some kind of explanation , some kind of apology , for the past ; to open my whole heart to you , and by convincing you , that though I have been always a blockhead , I have not been always a rascal , to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma -- from your sister ."
Anne gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to Kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft ' s side , to give a bias of any sort .
Elton ' s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired .
" You were a good while at Lyme , I think ?"
" I found ," said he , " that I was considered by Harville an engaged man !
Two months must bring it to the proof .
At these words , Marianne ' s eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter .
" You may _say_ what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine ."
He immediately went into the passage , opened the front door , and ushered her in himself .
Her mother , sisters , Fanny , all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland ; it was not an illusion of her own vanity .
I , who am owing all my happiness to _you_ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ?"
-- was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement ;-- and though Elinor could not speak , even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder .
In this state of schemes , and hopes , and connivance , June opened upon Hartfield .
I shall be at home in twenty minutes ."
She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain .
The girls looked all amazement .
--
I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now .
" Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other .
in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined ."
And then rising , she went away to join Marianne , whom she found , as she expected , in her own room , leaning , in silent misery , over the small remains of a fire , which , till Elinor ' s entrance , had been her only light .
Much , much beyond impropriety !-- It has sunk him , I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion .
It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person ."
He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr . Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her .
" Well , my dear ," said Mrs . Jennings , " and how did you travel ?"
I hardly ever get a letter ."
Miss Elliot , do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ?
Let me know what you think of this .
" Oh !
She heard of her walking with the Eltons , sitting with the Eltons , spending a day with the Eltons !
Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future .
Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm , as at that moment .
Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment .
Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister .
That young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless .
had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison .-- She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr . Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear .
I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles .
Every moment rather brought fresh agitation .
" So they will , my dear .
She exclaimed , however , with a very tolerable imitation of nature : --
But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs . S .-- _My_ representation , you see , has quite appeased her ."
I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them ."
In a long strip of meadow land , where there was ample space for all , they were thus divided , forming three distinct parties ; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation , and least complaisance , Anne necessarily belonged .
It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith ; she shook it off , and soon added in a different tone --
Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother ' s affairs might have done , if applied to in time .
Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs . Jennings , but he is old enough to be MY father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind .
They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect .
Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out .
" Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability .
The party drove off in very good spirits ; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves , and Anne walked up at the same time , in a sort of desolate tranquillity , to the Lodge , where she was to spend the first week .
But you shall hear it all .-- When I got to Mr . Palmer ' s , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child .
There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them .
--
She regained the street -- happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax ' s letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself .
" Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick ' s manners better than his .
Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge - ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister .
He is turning away .
She was afterwards looking for her shawl -- Frank Churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , Mr . Knightley could not tell .
His civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing .
Here Mrs Smith paused a moment ; but Anne had not a word to say , and she continued --
Thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in ."
There was , at times , a want of spirits about him which , if it did not denote indifference , spoke of something almost as unpromising .
She paused .-- Her daughter could not quite agree with her , but her dissent was not heard , and therefore gave no offence .
He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits ; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create .
If you think he will come , I shall think so too ; for you know Enscombe ."
Emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned .
Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again , and the other two proceeding together : and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk , where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed , and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow .
The second day brought them into the cherished , or the prohibited , county of Somerset , for as such was it dwelt on by turns in Marianne ' s imagination ; and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to Cleveland .
He came down by yesterday ' s coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own .
and that ' s so dreadful !"
" I had none .
Elizabeth had turned from him , Lady Russell overlooked him ; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances ; she felt that she owed him attention .
" No ; not immediately here .
He soon joined them again , successful , of course ; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home , and would call for them in a few minutes .
Little had Mrs . Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire , that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves , or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment .
How the long stage would pass ; how it was to affect their manners ; what was to be their sort of intercourse , she could not foresee .
A fine place , but very retired ."
I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr . Dixon is a principal in the business ."
I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge -- that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because I was a libertine , SHE must be a saint .
" Oh !
If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased , she would rather stay at home ."
The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs . Jennings ' s style of living , and set of acquaintance , than with her behaviour to themselves , which was invariably kind .
And books !-- Thomson , Cowper , Scott -- she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree .
They walked off , followed in half a minute by Mr . Knightley .
But ah !
" The shame ," he answered , " is all mine , or ought to be .
my sins , my sins !-- And I had plenty all the while in my pocket !-- One of my senseless tricks !-- I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life .-- Well --( sitting down again )-- go on -- what else ?"
Nobody doubts it ; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself .
She gave a moment ' s recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning .
She hoped no one could have said to her , " How could you be so unfeeling to your father ?-- I must , I will tell you truths while I can ."
Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while Sir John ' s independent employments were in existence only half the time .
His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed ;-- and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy .
" Nonsense !
" Oh no ; as to leaving the little boy ," both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and Anne , in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs .
He is not at all a well - bred young man .
He told me every thing ; his circumstances and plans , and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage .
The intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another .
Her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home ;-- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys .
She was first called to observe and approve him farther , by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister .
Edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice Marianne ' s altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her .
It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity .
for shame !
The others will be here presently ."
" That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be .
Elinor had met his eye , and looked conscious likewise .
But here you are in Bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot .
Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material .-- Mr . Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his .
Mr Elliot had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place .
Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain with him ."
_What_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10 , 000 l ., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet ' s superior .
I should never be out if they were all Sophys , or something of that sort .
I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have .
It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature .
Charles is out shooting .
" It was her very particular friend , you know ."
I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible ."
I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both ."
And as to my poor word ` success ,' which you quarrel with , I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it .
He had , in fact , though his sisters were now doing all they could for him , by calling him " poor Richard ," been nothing better than a thick - headed , unfeeling , unprofitable Dick Musgrove , who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name , living or dead .
He got up and moved away .
" Oh !
Mrs . Jennings , however , assured him directly , that she should not stand upon ceremony , for they were all cousins , or something like it , and she should certainly wait on Mrs . John Dashwood very soon , and bring her sisters to see her .
Nay , the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard ; and sometimes , for a few painful minutes , she believed it to be no more than friendship .
She was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good - breeding .
She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .
My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place .
I should like it of all things ," was not plainer in words than manner .
" Colonel Brandon give ME a living !-- Can it be possible ?"
Don ' t you , Mr .
I am not saying that she did not err in her advice .
" You must not talk so , Marianne .
Its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased .
A bowing acquaintance .
Elton ."
" This present from the Campbells ," said she --" this pianoforte is very kindly given ."
You must take care of yourself , Mrs .
With a hasty exclamation of Misery , and a sign to her sister not to follow her , she directly got up and hurried out of the room .
And take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this .
What is before me , I see .
His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening .
No one made any objection but Marianne , who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility , exclaimed , " Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME -- you know I detest cards .
She observed in a low voice , to her mother , that they were probably going down to Mr . Pratt ' s , near Plymouth .
I wonder what it can be !
You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am .
We must go , for the Westons come to us next week you know .
But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him .
I always regret excessively on dear Emma ' s account that she cannot be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs . Campbell will not be able to part with her at all .
This set the matter beyond a doubt .
Do let me hear what she says .'"
It would not be fair ; and yet you ought to have proof , for what is all this but assertion , and you shall have proof ."
Emma scarcely heard what was said .-- Her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet ;-- and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .
Poor Edward !
She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .
I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little .
Our part of London is very superior to most others !-- You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir .
Nothing wanting .
But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen .
" Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married .-- He was a particular friend of Sir John ' s .
" Dear Emma bears every thing so well ," said her father .
There is something so shocking in a child ' s being taken away from his parents and natural home !
I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ' s hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs . Weston .
" Ay , that we shall ."
The possibility of the young man ' s coming to Mrs . Goddard ' s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas .
Was it impossible ?-- No .-- Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding ; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner ; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour .-- For Harriet , it would be advantageous and delightful indeed .
Captain Benwick came not , however .
You must promise me not to sit up ."
" Certainly , he is not like Mr . Knightley .
Mr . Elton was only too happy .
You and I , Emma , will venture to take the part of the poor husband .
Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power ; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more , had not Marianne entreated her , with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability , not to speak to her for the world .
Fanny , rejoicing in her escape , and proud of the ready wit that had procured it , wrote the next morning to Lucy , to request her company and her sister ' s , for some days , in Harley Street , as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them .
" I do not believe ," said Mrs . Dashwood , with a good humoured smile , " that Mr . Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him .
Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her .
He was often hoping , intending to come -- but was always prevented .
Pain is no expiation .
A whole evening of back - gammon with her father , was felicity to it .
Oh !
She is very timid and silent .
" My dear Jane , say no more about it .
It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell ; but she really did not seem to feel it ."
" Thank you ," said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed .
Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends .
" I certainly do forget to think of _her_ ," said Emma , " as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend ."
Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension ; and Elinor ' s heart wrung for the feelings of Edward , while braving his mother ' s threats , for a woman who could not reward him .
And in short , she said more than her husband could long withstand , and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way , there was no help for it ; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable .
Their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival ; and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose , was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility .
The peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since ."
There are not many men who would act as he has done .
We are not boy and girl , to be captiously irritable , misled by every moment ' s inadvertence , and wantonly playing with our own happiness ."
As they approached Barton , indeed , and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar , some painful recollection , she grew silent and thoughtful , and turning away her face from their notice , sat earnestly gazing through the window .
She must have found the evening agreeable , Mr . Knightley , because she had Emma ."
Are you acquainted with Mr . Robert Ferrars ?
Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own .
" My love you contradict every body ," said his wife with her usual laugh .
" He writes like a sensible man ," replied Emma , when she had read the letter .
Such kind friends , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning ' s party .
No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr . Elton ' s absenting himself .
' It would have been beyond comparison ,' she said , ' the least evil of the two , and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse .'
A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world .
You can make little Charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word .
" No , I thank you : no , certainly not .
In spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion .
" Take care , Margaret .
" And Mrs . Perry and the children , how are they ?
We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , and with Mrs . Churchill ' s temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do .
By his description , a good deal like the second size double - barrel of mine , which you shot with one day round Winthrop ."
Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister ' s , but they were much more prepossessing .
I am sure of having their opinions with me ."
" Mr . Palmer is so droll !"
" We want only two more to be just the right number .
Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell .
This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by Elizabeth , who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father ' s heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot ' s eldest daughter .
The charm of Kellynch and of " Lady Elliot " all faded away .
I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it .
She paused -- and added in a low voice , " If I could but know HIS heart , everything would become easy ."
It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers ."
You must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there .
Was he at all such as he appears now ?"
But if he marries a very ignorant , vulgar woman , certainly I had better not visit her , if I can help it ."
It was not lost on me .
There was no bearing such an " always ;" and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of --
and by the means of this continual though gentle vent , was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion , but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter ; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex , and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other , she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies , and therefore determined ( though rather against the opinion of Sir John ) that as Mrs . Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune , to leave her card with her as soon as she married .
The case , you see , is --( but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room .
" No , sir ," she replied with firmness , " I shall NOT stay .
" I am sure William Larkins will not like it .
Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby ' s service , by her mother .
" But he talked of flannel waistcoats ," said Marianne ; " and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble ."
I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour .
Mrs . Dashwood smiled , and said nothing .
I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there .-- Oh !
said Anne , suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging .
But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed .
He was invited on good faith .
Mrs . Jennings , who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne ' s complaint more serious than Elinor , now looked very grave on Mr . Harris ' s report , and confirming Charlotte ' s fears and caution , urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant ; and Mr . Palmer , though treating their apprehensions as idle , found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood .
She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated .
I have crossed the Atlantic four times , and have been once to the East Indies , and back again , and only once ; besides being in different places about home : Cork , and Lisbon , and Gibraltar .
They could not listen to her description of him .
How she should begin -- how she should express herself in her note to Edward , was now all her concern .
Churchill ' s state , however , as many were ready to remind her , was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence -- and Mrs . Weston was at last persuaded to believe , or to say , that it must be by some attack of Mrs . Churchill that he was prevented coming .-- Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration ; she behaved very well , and betrayed no emotion .
I see her instrument is open ."
She saw nothing of the Willoughbys , nothing of Edward , and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay , be interesting to her .
Lord !
As Harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour .
And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment .
How they could be thrown together , and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl , of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration ,-- a girl too already engaged to his brother , and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family -- it was beyond her comprehension to make out .
Mamma , how shall we do without her ?"
His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy .
Irish , I dare say ."
" Your feelings are singular .
I suppose , however -- on recollection -- that the case may probably be THIS .
Though aware , before she began it , that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy , and confirm their separation for ever , she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it ; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling -- so far from the common decorum of a gentleman , as to send a letter so impudently cruel : a letter which , instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret , acknowledged no breach of faith , denied all peculiar affection whatever -- a letter of which every line was an insult , and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy .
It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way .
My esteem for your whole family is very sincere ; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt , or meant to express , I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem .
" At last we are alone .
" Yes , simpleton as I was !-- but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them .
But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon .
" How can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ?"
There was intimacy between them , and Mr . Cole had heard from Mr . Elton since his going away .
I perfectly understand Mr Robinson ' s directions , and have no fears ; and indeed , Mary , I cannot wonder at your husband .
Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless .
When one is in great pain , you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve .
Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
She asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern -- something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family ,-- something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward .
In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness , and Anne ' s astonishment increased .
It did not surprise , but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him .
My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good .
There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time .
said he .
" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr . and Mrs . Weston .
" Oh !
This is three times as large .-- And you have never any odd humours , my dear ."
I always think that no mutual --"
Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority .
said I , ` it is Miss Woodhouse : I am sure you will like to see her .'
yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance .
" It is certainly an unpleasant thing ," replied Mr . Dashwood , " to have those kind of yearly drains on one ' s income .
my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do !-- And it is a kindness to employ our men ."
With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body ' s feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body ' s destiny .
" I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs . Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination ."
" A surgeon !"
The dinner was a grand one , the servants were numerous , and every thing bespoke the Mistress ' s inclination for show , and the Master ' s ability to support it .
It was no longer in Emma ' s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures .
Have a little mercy on the poor men .
Whenever I looked towards the past , I saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged .
" I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet .
--" She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man ."
" It was not in her nature .
you forget yourself -- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _me_ , if you please ."
" You saw her answer !-- you wrote her answer too .
Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits .
He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together ; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that , I think ."
cried Mrs . Jennings , " I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him .
I do not pretend to be a wit .
Her Bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners .
" No ," said he , smiling , " that is no subject of regret at all .
His attentive deference to her father , contrasted with his former language , was odious ; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith , she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness , or the sound of his artificial good sentiments .
He was proud of his conquest , proud of tricking Edward , and very proud of marrying privately without his mother ' s consent .
And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood .
" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax ."
What can it possibly be ?
When is she dejected or melancholy ?
He dared not come to Bartlett ' s Buildings for fear of detection , and though their mutual impatience to meet , was not to be told , they could do nothing at present but write .
I am sure , a month ago , I had no more idea myself !-- The strangest things do take place !"
Between these two , she could want no possible attendance by day or night .
To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma ' s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits .
" Pray say no more .
It was a gentleman , it was Colonel Brandon himself .
She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London , nothing new of his plans , nothing certain even of his present abode .
" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- I pity you .-- I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .
It is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery .
He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked .
By his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth .
After clearing his throat , however , he proceeded thus --
" You do not go to town on horseback , do you ?"
how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me .
She wished , however to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned .
" I think , Edward ," said Mrs . Dashwood , as they were at breakfast the last morning , " you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions .
" I am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued .
Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot .
This was broken by Willoughby , who said with a faint smile , " It is folly to linger in this manner .
" If it would be good to her , I am sure it would be evil to himself ; a very shameful and degrading connexion .
one never thinks of married men ' s being beaux -- they have something else to do ."
By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you .
" Choice !-- how do you mean ?"
He could hardly suppose I should neglect them .
Mrs . Ferrars , not aware of their being Elinor ' s work , particularly requested to look at them ; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons ' s approbation , Fanny presented them to her mother , considerately informing her , at the same time , that they were done by Miss Dashwood .
The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps .
They were a couple worth looking at .
It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be ."
and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ?"
How well you put it on !-- so gratified !
" For my companion tells me ," said she , " that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning .
This was very wonderful if it were true ; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary , of his being " a man whom she had no wish to see ."
However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot ' s real character .
" But you should tell them of the letter , my dear ," said her father .
I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously .
She felt that , in quitting Donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with .
How many days was it , my dear , between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth ?"
My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense .
_Courtship_ -- a very good hint .
He coloured , and stammered out an unintelligible reply .
CHAPTER 28
after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter !"
Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over - throw of every thing .
He stopt a moment for recollection , and then , with another sigh , went on .
With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself ; and to persuade her to check her agitation , to wait , at least , with the appearance of composure , till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect , was impossible ; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings , by exclamations of wretchedness .
But Mr . Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects .
She felt the loss of Willoughby ' s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart ; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams , the misery of that poor girl , and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself , preyed altogether so much on her spirits , that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor ; and , brooding over her sorrows in silence , gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them .
If you prefer Mr . Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ?
The news of his cousins Anne ' s engagement burst on Mr Elliot most unexpectedly .
Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly .
Mr . Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of " Well , my dears , how does your book go on ?-- Have you got any thing fresh ?"
Elton ."
I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna .
Lady Russell felt this break - up of the family exceedingly .
On HER measures depended those of her two friends ; Mrs . Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods ' stay ; and Colonel Brandon was soon brought , by their united request , to consider his own abode there as equally determinate , if not equally indispensable .
He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would .
Can you be ?"
After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat , or in other words , in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs . Jennings ' s side , and in laughter without cause on Mrs . Palmer ' s , it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning , to which Mrs . Jennings and Elinor readily consented , as having likewise some purchases to make themselves ; and Marianne , though declining it at first was induced to go likewise .
I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me !
I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours .-- My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork -- a roast loin of pork --"
Perhaps indifferent , if indifference could exist under such circumstances .
She was good enough for Mr . Elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for Highbury -- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by Harriet ' s side .
Mrs . Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .
Well , pretty good news , is not it ?
His father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and Mr . John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them .
CHAPTER VIII
Mr . Weston had accompanied her to Mrs . Bates ' s , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs . Bates ' s parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .
Emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face -- her features -- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty .
Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself , it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville .
Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich .
She could have made an inquiry or two , as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails ;-- it was at her tongue ' s end -- but she abstained .
But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world ."
Though WE have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ?
He understood that she was in need of a dwelling ; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage , he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary , if the situation pleased her .
All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it .
He was here only a quarter of an hour , and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay -- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said .
You may see the end of the house .
" I have some hope ," resumed he , " of my uncle ' s being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her .
They meant to take a long drive this morning ; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills .
Oh !
She still screamed and sobbed lustily , kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her , and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week , some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple , the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch , and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it , gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected .-- She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother ' s arms , in quest of this medicine , and as the two boys chose to follow , though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind , the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours .
Captain Harville was no reader ; but he had contrived excellent accommodations , and fashioned very pretty shelves , for a tolerable collection of well - bound volumes , the property of Captain Benwick .
Why don ' t he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ?
" When the weather is settled , and I have recovered my strength ," said she , " we will take long walks together every day .
" Mr . Perry ," said he , in a voice of very strong displeasure , " would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for .
But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying ,
Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr . Gray ' s shop .
When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle ' s generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger .
On this article I can fully acquit him .
I was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; I ought not to have attempted more .
-- For some moments her voice was lost ; but recovering herself , she added , and with greater calmness than before --" I am now perfectly satisfied , I wish for no change .
He would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder .
Mrs . Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise .
Margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light .
The shortness of his visit , the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them , originated in the same fettered inclination , the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother .
" When do you write to Colonel Brandon , ma ' am ?"
No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together .
_Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon ."
You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends ."
In this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr . Woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and Emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to Jane ,
It had been my doing , solely mine .
Your interest , Sir Walter , is in pretty safe hands .
I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement .-- But I had no choice .
When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to - morrow , I had compassion on him ."
Mr . Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in .
" Ah !-- no ,-- have you forgot what passed in town ?-- That infamous letter -- Did she shew it you ?"
" What did you hear ?"
I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr . Martin , or to be suspected of it ."
Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved , but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt .
Not that I think Mr . Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up .
Dancing with open windows !-- I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs . Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it ."
She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the casement there , immediately called Mr . Knightley ' s attention , and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others , as if it had passed within the same apartment .
Campbell ."
Oh !
I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed .
She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes .
The power of disappointing them , it was true , must always be her ' s .
Robert ' s offence was unpardonable , but Lucy ' s was infinitely worse .
" Being very sure I have long lost your affections , I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you ; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another ' s .
Then changing from a frown to a smile --" No , do not tell me -- I do not want to know what you mean .-- Where is my father ?-- When are we to begin dancing ?"
After a short pause .
My poor mother does not know how to bear it .
Mrs Clay ' s affections had overpowered her interest , and she had sacrificed , for the young man ' s sake , the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter .
" A great many things , I assure you .
You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room ."
She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate .
I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short .
" Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her .
" It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it ," said the young man , " though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far ; but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing ."
my dear , it is quite understood , I give you my word .
My mother ' s are really very good indeed .
It is impossible ."
Mr . Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man ' s company .
" Not at all ."
Her mind did become settled , but it was settled in a gloomy dejection .
He came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse , and defying Miss Smith .
" I shall never see her , if she goes by London ."
When he gave his promise to his father , he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a - piece .
The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of Elinor ' s distress .
I warrant you , Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round .
" And had you really some at hand yourself ?
The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist .
" I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs . Jennings at home .
The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home ; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham ; and if no general engagement collected them at the park , the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there , where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne , and by his favourite pointer at her feet .
It was forwarded to me from Delaford , and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell ; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly , which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body , and which I believe gave offence to some .
Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy .
A few moments ' reflection , however , produced a very happy idea , and she exclaimed ;--
" Elliot !"
" And so , ma ' am , all these thing considered ," said Mrs Musgrove , in her powerful whisper , " though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it , and Henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them .
Emma was almost too much astonished to answer ; but Mrs . Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on .
But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination .
She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them ;-- an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful .
Harriet was silent .
She was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not .
Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed .-- Marianne ' s feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment .
" I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick - room than Charles , for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about .
" I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them ," said Elinor ; " you were all in the same room together , were not you ?"
As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty .
And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter ' s making a second match .
With her children they were in continual raptures , extolling their beauty , courting their notice , and humouring their whims ; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it , was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing , if she happened to be doing any thing , or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress , in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight .
Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .
" How is your niece , Miss Bates ?-- I want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece .
Elinor had seen so little of Mr . Palmer , and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself , that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family .
Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon , and his father had at first half a mind to go with him , but the ladies could not consent .
You divert me against my conscience .
VOLUME I
Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express ."
Enscombe is in Yorkshire ?"
He had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it .
He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it .
Mary was in excellent spirits , enjoying the gaiety and the change , and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother - in - law ' s carriage with four horses , and with her own complete independence of Camden Place , that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought , and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house , as they were detailed to her .
I shall never forget his happiness .
" I am afraid , none at all ."
" Can you really ?"
" Oh !
If Mr . and Mrs . Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done ."
She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent Captain Benwick ' s manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , " I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends ," but the Admiral interrupted her with --
The cheeks which had been pale now glowed , and the movements which had hesitated were decided .
They were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of Jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work for them .
" They told me something ," said Harriet rather hesitatingly ;" but it is nothing of any consequence ."
Mr Elliot was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open .
Pray come in ; do come in .
The rest of the company soon dropt in .
Charles and Mary also came in , of course , during their visit , and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell , and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain .
It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence ."
Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do .
Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place .
That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary , from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself .
Shall I tell you my guess ?"
Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls .
" I hope she does .
Were it possible , she must say it must be Edward .
" Oh !
" Yes , certainly it does .
Every body who saw it was pleased , but Mr . Elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism .
" Yes ," he replied , " any body may know how highly I think of her ."
my dear , you are very modest .
" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense .
" Such a home , indeed !
I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .
What a horrible idea !
Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home ."
" I am sure Lady Russell would like him .
I must have given you up ."
He had his shepherd ' s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her .
" Dear me !-- How should I ever have borne it !
" I felt my luck , Admiral , I assure you ;" replied Captain Wentworth , seriously .
But why must she consent to be with the Eltons ?-- Here is quite a separate puzzle ."
" You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you .-- So cold and artificial !-- I had always a part to act .-- It was a life of deceit !-- I know that I must have disgusted you ."
" I will not oppose such kind politeness ; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient ."
But this he declined , as he was dirty and wet .
Money , you know , coming down with money -- two daughters at once -- it cannot be a very agreeable operation , and it streightens him as to many things .
Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions .
" I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled .
She met him with a hand that would be taken , and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister .
" I should always be happy ," replied Elinor , " to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr . Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ?
" Four years !"
` Well ,' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .'
my dear , as Perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred .-- Better not move at all , better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air .
There are several odd - looking men walking about here , who , I am told , are sailors .
You must allow for an injured , angry woman .
She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them .
" I met William Larkins ," continued Mr . Elton , " as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him .-- William seemed rather out of humour .
My best love , of course ."
I always say there is something direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans , though a good many things I assure you are suspected ; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother , Mr . Suckling , who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours .
She caught every syllable with panting eagerness ; her hand , unknowingly to herself , closely pressed her sister ' s , and tears covered her cheeks .
She had a great wish to see him .
To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family , nay , perhaps herself -- I was no longer at my own disposal .
Mr . Martin is a very respectable young man , but I cannot admit him to be Harriet ' s equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her .
He joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them .
He had reached Randalls the evening before .
" Shall I tell you ."
This discovery laid many smaller matters open .
" Have not you mistaken the day ?"
" I never had the smallest , I assure you ."
said Elinor , reproachfully ; " a note would have answered every purpose .-- Why was it necessary to call ?"
He persisted in having loved none but her .
I see the difference plain enough .
And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle ' s care , the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs . Ferrars , is perhaps , altogether a little extraordinary .
Anne , far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure , replied , " I can easily believe it .
But so eager and so resolute !
Her next beginning was ,
.
The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold ."
Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him ."
They are some of my very old friends .
She had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period .
The others joined them , and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included .
The wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting .
" Difference !
Voices approached the shop -- or rather one voice and two ladies : Mrs . Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door .
" Yes , yes , pray pass _me_ ," added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; " _I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse , or any other young lady .
My dear Harriet , what do you mean ?
They were sneering and negligent .
continued Mrs Musgrove ; " he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care !
As you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession ."
" And , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to South End .
If it failed to produce equal exertion , it could not be an equal conviction ."
She had not even a share in his opening compliments .-- Her name was not mentioned ;-- and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father ' s suspicion .
" I will say no more about him ," cried Emma , " you turn every thing to evil .
I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal .
So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this .
Emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that Frank Churchill ' s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour .
" These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them .
Kitty , a fair but frozen maid .
Mrs . Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change .
.
" The next time you write to your good father , Miss Elliot , pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft ' s , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place .
-- And in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , " He will soon be gone .
Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance .
They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home , and Sir John came in before their visit ended .
Elinor laughed .
She was your governess , I think ?"
She was seated in her mother ' s lap , covered with kisses , her wound bathed with lavender - water , by one of the Miss Steeles , who was on her knees to attend her , and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other .
" I only wish ," replied her sister , " there were any thing I COULD do , which might be of comfort to you ."
She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared .
One other short call in Harley Street , in which Elinor received her brother ' s congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton without any expense , and on Colonel Brandon ' s being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two , completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters in town ;-- and a faint invitation from Fanny , to come to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way , which of all things was the most unlikely to occur , with a more warm , though less public , assurance , from John to Elinor , of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at Delaford , was all that foretold any meeting in the country .
" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first ."
Mr . Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage .
He had left the country in consequence .
" Well , my dear , I must be gone before I have had half my talk out .
The conviction seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it .
" As good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you .
Do you know any family of that name ?"
She paused a few moments .
Have you any thing to send or say , besides the ` love ,' which nobody carries ?"
" Now , this must be very bad for you ," said he , suddenly rousing from a little reverie , " to be coming and finding us here .
Elinor first spoke .
Mr . Woodhouse hesitated .--" Not near so often , my dear , as I could wish ."
After this speech he was gone as soon as possible .
But so little were they , anymore than the others , inclined to oblige her , that if Sir John dined from home , she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject , than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself .
Elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally .
But when this passed away , when her spirits became collected , when she saw that to the perfect good - breeding of the gentleman , he united frankness and vivacity , and above all , when she heard him declare , that of music and dancing he was passionately fond , she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay .
She was silent .-- Elinor ' s security sunk ; but her self - command did not sink with it .
He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends .
A very few days had passed after this adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began :
His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers .
" Why do you smile ?"
It is the garden of England , you know .
She loved every body , was interested in every body ' s happiness , quicksighted to every body ' s merits ; thought herself a most fortunate creature , and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother , and so many good neighbours and friends , and a home that wanted for nothing .
They were never tolerated at Maple Grove .
Elinor ' s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived , without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless , for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her .
Then she had , indeed , been a pitiable object ; for she had caught cold on the journey , and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain ; and all this among strangers , with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse , and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense .
" Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all ."
said she .
The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour , and of Anne so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in Bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed .
Could it be Mr Elliot ?
" My dear friend ," cried Lucy , as soon as they were by themselves , " I come to talk to you of my happiness .
My first doth affliction denote , Which my second is destin ' d to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal .--
" Mrs . Cole has servants to send .
I am persuaded that Mrs . Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him ,) and on that account is eager to get him away ;-- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him .
This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure !
She watched him well .
He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course I cannot decide ), that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence .
CHAPTER XVII
Jane desired me to do it , so I always do : and so I began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell , than I burst out , quite frightened , with ` Bless me !
I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke ."
Luckily Lady Middleton ' s mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine .
You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ).
" Well , well , I am ready ;"-- and turning again to Emma , " but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man ; you have only had _my_ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary :"-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction .
She boldly acknowledged herself flattered , and continued her enquiries .
I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs . Ferrars considered it in that light -- a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all .
They will be so very happy to see you ."
" Why , to be sure ," said he , seeming to recollect himself , " people have little , have very little in their power .
My dear Harriet , what are you thinking of ?
Elinor , with a very heavy heart , aware of the pain she was going to communicate , and perceiving , by Marianne ' s letter , how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it , then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed , and entreat her directions for the future ; while Marianne , who came into the drawing - room on Mrs . Jennings ' s going away , remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote , watching the advancement of her pen , grieving over her for the hardship of such a task , and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother .
The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten !-- My dear Mr . E ., he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must .-- Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric ;-- and his servants forgot it .
It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness .
In spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet , which Mrs . Weston had just gone through by herself .
She looked down as she said this , amiably bashful , with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her .
Edward have got some business at Oxford , he says ; so he must go there for a time ; and after THAT , as soon as he can light upon a Bishop , he will be ordained .
here comes your beau , Nancy ,' my cousin said t ' other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house .
" I am afraid it cannot take place very soon ."
Emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets , which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves .
She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done -- One door nailed up -- Quantities of matting -- My dear Jane , indeed you must .
" Oh , what a sweet house !-- How very beautiful !-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much ."
Marianne could never love by halves ; and her whole heart became , in time , as much devoted to her husband , as it had once been to Willoughby .
.
Now will be the time .
Astonished and shocked at so unlover - like a speech , she was almost ready to cry out , " Lord !
He is in Highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston .
" I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday ."
You must have done well .
" Yes -- I _have_ called there ; passing the door , I thought it better .
I thought you were speaking of some man of property : Mr Wentworth was nobody , I remember ; quite unconnected ; nothing to do with the Strafford family .
A young _woman_ , if she fall into bad hands , may be teazed , and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with ; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_ ' s being under such restraint , as not to be able to spend a week with his father , if he likes it ."
She must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little ; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do .
She read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness .
cried Sir John ; " what , is HE in the country ?
She sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read ; but the book was soon thrown aside , and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room , pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window , in hopes of distinguishing the long - expected rap .
--
She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech .
They were alike too , in a general benevolence of temper , and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance .
" None , I thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together .
Disputable , however , as might be the taste of such a termination , it was in itself a charming walk , and the view which closed it extremely pretty .-- The considerable slope , at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood , gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds ; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur , well clothed with wood ;-- and at the bottom of this bank , favourably placed and sheltered , rose the Abbey Mill Farm , with meadows in front , and the river making a close and handsome curve around it .
She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of .
" Well , I am so sorry !-- Oh !
He had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it .
" He appears rough to you ," said Emma , " because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough .
cried Marianne , " there has been no engagement ."
I thought you had lost half your property , at least .
John Knightley only was in mute astonishment .-- That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man ' s house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed - time , of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers , was a circumstance to strike him deeply .
They had no conversation together , no intercourse but what the commonest civility required .
At Christmas every body invites their friends about them , and people think little of even the worst weather .
Emma ' s going away directly after tea might be giving offence .
I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it .
You will not be sorry to find yourself at home ."
" And what did the Colonel say ?"
" I was going to observe , sir ," said Frank Churchill , " that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ' s catching cold -- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls !
Were you often in the same society ?"
Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax ' s opinion last night ."
She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy .
" Ha !
As soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment .
She blessed the favouring blindness .
" Do you compare your conduct with his ?"
" You may well be amazed ," returned Mrs . Weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma might have time to recover -- " You may well be amazed .
said Elinor .
At last , however , my resolution was taken , and I had determined , as soon as I could engage her alone , to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display .
Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it cannot be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself .
The wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening .
" Have you been lately in Sussex ?"
He said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one .
It was also a very early speculation with Emma .
" Aye , _that_ may suit your humble ideas of yourself ;-- I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life ."
Though now the middle of December , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of Highbury .
How fast I made money in her .
Dinner - parties and evening - parties were made for him and his lady ; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day .
She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of Harriet ' s wondering questions .
With such a reward for her tears , the child was too wise to cease crying .
Mr . Elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday ' s party at his friend Cole ' s , and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire , the butter , the cellery , the beet - root , and all the dessert .
Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow ; and Mrs Smith , observing the high colour in her face , said --
Captain Wentworth ' s eyes were also turned towards her .
The parties stood thus :
or is it equally criminal in every body ?
NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place .
She would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother ' s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important .-- It had a high claim to forbearance .
" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr . Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else .
" I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain .
no "-- and Emma could just catch the words , " so superior to Mr .
Nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions .
It is time for us to be going indeed .
Might not the evening end in a dance ?
" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it .
Emma had feelings , less of curiosity than of pride or propriety , to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects ; and she made a point of Harriet ' s going with her , that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible .
she exclaimed , " he is there -- he is there -- Oh !
So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it .
Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it ."
" You should not have suspected me now ; the case is so different , and my age is so different .
Trust to me ."
One cannot wonder , one cannot wonder .
Cole ."
It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world ."
To Mrs . Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world .
" Cannot you , my dear Emma -- cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear ?"
" No ; he thought it very far from an improvement -- a very bad plan -- much worse than the other .
She spoke to him , ordered , entreated , and insisted in vain .
" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr . Elton .
You must have seen that I did .
" Yes -- a good deal _nearer_ ."
But who else was there to employ ?
The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever .
But I have just left Marianne in bed , and , I hope , almost asleep ; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , I will drink the wine myself ."
In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour , when Marianne , whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise , was startled by a rap at the door .
The first error and the worst lay at her door .
But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me .
" In one respect , perhaps , Mr . Elton ' s manners are superior to Mr . Knightley ' s or Mr . Weston ' s .
About this time the two Miss Steeles , lately arrived at their cousin ' s house in Bartlett ' s Buildings , Holburn , presented themselves again before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets ; and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality .
" This is very strange !-- sure he need not wait to be older ."
Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising .
Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters .
" I cannot name a day ," said he , " till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you ."
She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs . Jennings .
" So , you are come at last !
how poor they will be !-- I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house .
Mr . Woodhouse was resigned .
" Oh !"
CHAPTER 15
Mrs . Elton ' s resources were inadequate to such an attack .
The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know .
And then lowering her voice , " I suppose Mrs . Jennings has heard all about it .
Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected .
no , there is but one .
Marianne ' s ideas were still , at intervals , fixed incoherently on her mother , and whenever she mentioned her name , it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor , who , reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness , and wretched for some immediate relief , fancied that all relief might soon be in vain , that every thing had been delayed too long , and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child , or to see her rational .
" Oh !
Will you promise me to mention it , when you see them again ?
That is , I _presume_ it to be so on her side , and I can _answer_ for its being so on his .
Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him ."
When his letter to Mrs . Weston arrived , Emma had the perusal of it ; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued their strength .
I hope he will be calling soon .
Songs and proverbs , all talk of woman ' s fickleness .
" How horrid all this is !"
I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot .
She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room .
People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style ."
I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr . Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr . Frank Churchill ' s situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect .
It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth , within half a mile of him ; they would have to frequent the same church , and there must be intercourse between the two families .
" There we differ , Mary ," said Anne .
A heavy scene however awaited me , before I could leave Devonshire ;-- I was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement .
Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr . Frank Churchill ' s not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls .
CHAPTER XV
" Thank you , thank you -- but on no account .-- I would rather walk .-- And for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone !-- I , who may so soon have to guard others !"
She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could , but she did not want to lessen theirs .
I will not reason here -- nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound .
She could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for Elizabeth ' s sake .
" He told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now .
A sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ?
What would you advise me to do in such a case , Miss Dashwood ?
We will not despair , however .
Long before I was enough recovered to talk , I was perfectly able to reflect .
Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr . Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ' s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr . Elton ' s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them .
said Miss Bates , joyfully ; " my mother is so pleased !-- she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress .
This had happened the year before .
Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions -- they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well - disposed , good - hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself .
You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general .
" I see how it is ," said she .
He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William .
She held the parcel towards her , and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top .
Mr . Perry has been with her , as you probably heard ."
That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents ."
That was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure .
" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ ,"-- said Mr . Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done .
I am so ill I can hardly speak .
If Mr . Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .
" She had set out from Mrs . Goddard ' s half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford ' s ."
Marianne looked at her steadily , and said , " You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear .
said Marianne , " money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it .
" May she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better ."
You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other .
" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne .
always my kindest friend on every occasion .
" I hope not ," he replied , trying to look cheerful ; and with a forced smile presently added , " It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment !"
" Your uncle !"
( laughing heartily ); " I would not venture over a horsepond in it .
" We are sure of excellent fires ," continued he , " and every thing in the greatest comfort .
( in a tone of wonder and pity ,) I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery .
Such events are very interesting , but the suspense of them cannot last long .
" Lady Dalrymple , Lady Dalrymple ," was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her .
He had intended , on first arriving , to proceed very soon into Shropshire , and visit the brother settled in that country , but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off .
The neighbourhood was not large , but the Musgroves were visited by everybody , and had more dinner - parties , and more callers , more visitors by invitation and by chance , than any other family .
While you were in the smallest degree wavering , I said nothing about it , because I would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me .
A day or two passed without producing anything .
He was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion .
That was what I said immediately .-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed !-- Poor Edward !-- he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society !-- but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected .
She then took another line of expediency , and looking into the doubtful room , observed ,
She remembered what Mr . Knightley had once said to her about Mr . Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr . Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself .
When they stopped at the door , Mrs . Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call ; and as she had no business at Gray ' s , it was resolved , that while her young friends transacted their ' s , she should pay her visit and return for them .
His air , his coat , his horse .
It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world .
" Yes ," he replied gravely , " once I have .
How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued !
It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy .-- She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying .
But whether she would do for a lady ' s maid , I am sure I can ' t tell .
cried Mary in an ecstasy , " just as I said !
" Very well ," replied Emma ; " a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased .
A piece of paper was found on the table this morning --( dropt , we suppose , by a fairy )-- containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in ."
Mr . Knightley cannot stop .
It was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it ."
You must see the difference ."
It had not been built many years and was in good repair .
Mr . Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused .
The waiter came into the room soon afterwards .
Marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself , was very urgent to prevent her sister ' s going at all ; and Mrs . Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor ' s service , so very much disliked Mrs . John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward ' s part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again .
Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long .
She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing - room , the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby , under the influence of four summers and two children ; and , on Anne ' s appearing , greeted her with --
I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands .
They were permitted to go alone ; and with a cordial nod from one , and a graceful bow from the other , the two gentlemen took leave .
I had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences ."
Her countenance , perhaps , might express some watchfulness ; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister .
By a former marriage , Mr . Henry Dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters .
" You know what you are about ."
" I am very glad I did think of her .
Willoughby , on his side , gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance , which an evident wish of improving it could offer .
She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax ' s feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each .
The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion - house ; from whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage , and direct every thing as they liked on the spot ;-- could chuse papers , project shrubberies , and invent a sweep .
He had seen Mrs Croft , too ; she was at Taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over .
John Dashwood was greatly astonished ; but his nature was calm , not open to provocation , and he never wished to offend anybody , especially anybody of good fortune .
Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond .
Elinor would not speak .
" Indeed !"
I made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl -- Mrs . Dixon ' s wedding - present .-- So kind of her to think of my mother !
" Is anything the matter with her ?"
It would only be giving trouble and distress .
It was too old a story .-- Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet .-- They took a few turns together along the walk .-- The shade was most refreshing , and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day .
I am very sure you did me good .
said Edward , willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject .
It had originated in misapprehension entirely .
Emma , finding her so determined upon neglecting her music , had nothing more to say ; and , after a moment ' s pause , Mrs . Elton chose another subject .
cried Marianne .
The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father .
Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before , when a full account of the whole had burst on her ; but still it must be talked of , she must make enquiries , she must regret the imprudence , lament the result , and Captain Wentworth ' s name must be mentioned by both .
If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr . Perry .
" Would I !"
They were both in ecstasies .
You would have thrown yourself out of all good society .
" You were mentioning May .
" Indeed !
She almost ran out of the room , and as soon as the door was closed , burst into tears of joy , which at first she thought would never cease .
But it was more probable that he should be come to stay .
The next morning brought Mr . Frank Churchill again .
Why does not Perry see her ?"
Nobody talked about it .
We both abhor suspense .
When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ?"
Mrs Musgrove interposed .
" But he told you that he loved you ."
This desponding turn of mind , though it could not be communicated to Mrs . Dashwood , gave additional pain to them all in the parting , which shortly took place , and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor ' s feelings especially , which required some trouble and time to subdue .
They were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern .
If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand .
Whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine .
She would take place of me then , and Henrietta would not dislike that .
" And who are the Ellisons ?"
So passed the first three weeks .
And they both long to see you of all things , for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world ; and I have told them it is all very true , and a great deal more .
Oh yes !
They were all three walking about together for an hour or two -- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards in Highbury .
" Should I ?
" You are quite in the right ," replied Elinor calmly .
" Do you ?-- I have no doubt .
Tell me that not only your house will remain the same , but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling ; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me ."
Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham .
Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style ; he , half serious and half jesting , maintaining the scheme for the play , and she , invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that , however determined to go to Camden Place herself , she should not think herself very well used , if they went to the play without her .
While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going -- her father began his inquiries .
Edward made no answer .
The deception could not continue after this ; and an explanation immediately took place , by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment , without any material loss of happiness to either , for Mrs . Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another , and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first .
That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was -- yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort .
He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma ' s feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr . Knightley ' s high superiority of character .
Sometimes I thought it had been -- but it never was ."
" I mean that he has done it ," answered Mr . Knightley , with smiling but determined decision , " and been accepted ."
A little while ago , every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at Mr . Cole ' s , or balls at the Crown .
" And yet ," said Emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it was better , however , to know the worst at once -- she hurried on --" And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is .
Poor Brandon !
CHAPTER 48
I know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray ."
He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor ' s merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse ' s character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor ' s .
" Depend upon it , Mrs . Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did .
The next question was --
My astonishment !-- but it would be impossible to describe what I felt .
To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman !
The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married ; and Elinor now hoped , as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them , to prevail on her sister , who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell , to go out again by degrees as she had done before .
" No , Marianne , never .
" She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs . Smallridge ' s children -- a dear friend of Mrs . Elton ' s -- a neighbour of Maple Grove ; and , by the bye , I wonder how Mrs . Elton bears the disappointment ?"
" How do you do my dear ?"
With a faint blush , she presently replied ,
This is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly !"
said Mrs . John Knightley .-- " It is so long since I have seen her , except now and then for a moment accidentally in town !
Mr . Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity .
It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility -- and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me .
Oh !
I had imagined him , I confess , a degree or two nearer gentility ."
Dear Miss Woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ?"
" Yes , and Miss Atkinson , who dined with him once at the Wallises , says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with ."
The very day of Mr . Elton ' s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ' s services towards her friend .
Mrs . Jennings sat on Elinor ' s right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and Willoughby , and said to Marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , " I have found you out in spite of all your tricks .
But that it was so , had not only been declared by Lucy ' s eyes at the time , but was declared over again the next morning more openly , for at her particular desire , Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone , to tell her how happy she was .
To Lady Russell , indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god - daughter , favourite , and friend .
Her faith was plighted , and Mr Elliot ' s character , like the Sultaness Scheherazade ' s head , must live another day .
You misled me by the term gentleman .
Though I think he had better not have married .
Before they were beyond her hearing , however , Louisa spoke again .
Let me entreat you to run no risks .
Marianne seemed much struck .
His manners to THEM , though calm , were perfectly kind ; to Mrs . Jennings , most attentively civil ; and on Colonel Brandon ' s coming in soon after himself , he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say , that he only wanted to know him to be rich , to be equally civil to HIM .
-- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would .
" I do not know ; but I can hardly suppose that , at Admiral Croft ' s time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this ."
I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else .
Miss Elliot , surrounded by her cousins , and the principal object of Colonel Wallis ' s gallantry , was quite contented .
A crowd in a little room -- Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words .
But it WAS said , I know , very well , and by more than one ; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks , that nobody in their senses could expect Mr . Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton , with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune , for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all ; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself .
He must be gone within a few hours , though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt , to lessen his repugnance .
But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife , with " Oh !
You want your neighbours ' opinions .
" Here is some mistake I am sure -- some dreadful mistake .
He was brought , not from doubt or suspense , but from misery to happiness ;-- and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine , flowing , grateful cheerfulness , as his friends had never witnessed in him before .
But Sir John would not be satisfied -- the carriage should be sent for them and they must come .
But he was confident that he should soon be rich : full of life and ardour , he knew that he should soon have a ship , and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted .
From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse ' s encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness !-- Latterly she had been more and more aware of it .
When the Crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ?
It was now his object to marry .
When it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone .
So there I have the whip hand of you ."
He was thinking .
" My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for .-- I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well .
Chapter 10
But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister ' s choice ?"
We really seem quite the fashion .
Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs . Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr . Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it .
The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove , " My brother Mr . Suckling ' s seat ;"-- a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove .
Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ?"
there was no getting away from one ' s self .
" I do assure you ," he replied , " that I have long thought on this point , as you think now .
To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one ' s independence ."
What say you to Mr . Weston and Mr . Elton ?
" Esteem him !
I give you notice that as I find your son , so I shall judge of him .-- I am no flatterer ."
Knightley ?"
Mrs . Jennings enforced the necessity .
If a man had not a wife , he soon wants to be afloat again ."
With the Musgroves , there was the happy chat of perfect ease ; with Captain Harville , the kind - hearted intercourse of brother and sister ; with Lady Russell , attempts at conversation , which a delicious consciousness cut short ; with Admiral and Mrs Croft , everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest , which the same consciousness sought to conceal ; and with Captain Wentworth , some moments of communications continually occurring , and always the hope of more , and always the knowledge of his being there .
" Yes -- could that be wrong after all that had passed ?-- But I cannot talk ."
She knew , that when he now took up the Baronetage , it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople , and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd , his agent , from his thoughts .
Emma knew it to have been very much the case .
I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort ."
" Why , to own the truth ," cried Miss Bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , " if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr . Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs . Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days .
Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen .
John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again ; it rather gave them satisfaction ; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive .
While he was so dull , it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable .
She turned through the same gate , but could not see them .
This however was more than she could believe herself ; and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne , it was beyond her wish .
If he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come .
As soon as they were out of sight , the ladies of Captain Wentworth ' s party began talking of them .
dear Mrs Croft ," cried Mrs Musgrove , unable to let her finish her speech , " there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement .
It was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together .
" My dearest child ," said her mother , laughing , " at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty ."
I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad .
The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening .
Wentworth ; Captain Wentworth of the navy .
" He spoke of its being out of repair ."
Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period -- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it .
Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event , and give farther particulars ,-- but day after day passed off , and brought no letter , no tidings .
" Hum "-- said Mrs . Ferrars --" very pretty ,"-- and without regarding them at all , returned them to her daughter .
His wish of staying longer evidently did not please ; but it was not opposed .
I could wish the stairs were handsome .
Modest Sir Walter !
Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles , by whom their company , in fact was as little valued , as it was professedly sought .
" My dear ," said he to his lady , " it is very provoking that we should be so few .
I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together .
" Indeed !"
Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected , Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties , which , whether at home or abroad , formed only for cards , could have little to amuse her .
" Engagement !"
" Oh !
It would be a great comfort to Mr . Weston , as he grew older -- and even Mr . Weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and Mrs . Weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again .
she repeated , surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before .
Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house , with a countenance which showed something to be wrong ; and they had set off immediately , informed and directed as they passed , towards the spot .
Well , my dear , I wish you joy of it again and again ; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world , I think I shall soon know where to look for them ."
Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ?
Emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort .
said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .
She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid .
Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent .
" Upon the knoll behind the house .
" And you really are not engaged to him !"
Mr . Dixon ' s preference of her music to her friend ' s , I can answer for being very decided ."
He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject .
I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- I am sick of England -- and would leave it to - morrow , if I could ."
No , you shall send it to Hartfield , if you please .
She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness .
He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy .
In this calm kind of way , with very little interest on either side , they continued to talk , both of them out of spirits , and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere .
And thus ended their discourse .
One thing DID disturb her ; and of that she made her daily complaint .
" You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual .-- He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible ."
said Marianne ; " my dear Edward , this must not be ."
He will think all the happiness , all the advantage , on your side of the question ; all the merit on mine .
Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his guests .
No sooner was his father ' s funeral over , than Mrs . John Dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother - in - law , arrived with her child and their attendants .
Chapter 14
I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her .
We are not asked to dine with them , however , till the day after , Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to - morrow .
It was a merry , joyous party , and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth .
-- And when Mrs . Bates was saying something to Emma , whispered farther , " We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might have ; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor .-- Oh !
I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer ."
" Jane !"
I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours .
" I should very much like to see Lyme again ," said Anne .
The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven !
You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed ."
" Mr . Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him .
Thy ready wit the word will soon supply .
We really must wish you good night ."
Mr . Weston must be between forty and fifty ."
He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through .
" Not to my feelings .
The change was indubitable .
I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult ., as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose .
There is something about Frederick more to our taste ."
He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta .
" I suspect ," said Sir Walter coolly , " that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall .
" Altered beyond his knowledge ."
She rather suspected it to be so , on the very first evening of their being together , from his listening so attentively while she sang to them ; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons ' dining at the cottage , the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again .
Sir Walter Elliot , of Kellynch Hall , in Somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the Baronetage ; there he found occupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unwelcome sensations , arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century ; and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed .
" I hope Mrs . Bates and Miss Fairfax are --"
ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing -- What I felt was dreadful !-- My resolution was soon made , and at eight o ' clock this morning I was in my carriage .
" Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr . Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do .
These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain , and severe was its kind ; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again , and returning through the well - known apartments .
He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets .
How much could it not tempt her to forgive !
The struggle was great -- but it ended too soon .
Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _The_ _Rev . _ _Philip_ _Elton_ , _White - Hart_ , _Bath_ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher ' s cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank .
Breakfast had not been long over , when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick ; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme .
replied Charles , " what ' s an evening party ?
" Oh , don ' t be so sly before us ," said Mrs . Palmer ; " for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he is extremely handsome .
" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man .
She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same .
Mr . Weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him .
You are trying not to smile ."
So dull , so wretchedly dull !-- But I have much to say to you on that head , which cannot be said now ."
" He had been so fortunate as to -- I forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them .
" Do you know Miss Bates ' s niece ?
" I have often thought them the worst of the two ," replied he coolly .
Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was , above all things , the most material to her interest , and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings !
` How could he contrive to come ?
But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her .
I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it .-- But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing .
All these jealousies and discontents , however , were so totally unsuspected by Mrs . Jennings , that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together ; and generally congratulated her young friends every night , on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long .
There she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ?
But it was too late .
An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack , and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison .
But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment ."
She would not look again .
And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella ' s throat ."
" Ay , so do , Sir John ," cried Mrs . Jennings , " and then perhaps you may find out what his business is ."
I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it , eight years and a half ago .
" Oh !"
I have really for some time past , for at least these three months , cared nothing about him .
I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy .
I shall not be far off , if you want me ."
Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going .
You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn .
It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father ' s assistance .
" Do you think so ?
It is infinitely too bad .
You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as I cannot be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine ."
" Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted ,"-- observed Mrs . Weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover .--" The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes .
I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town .
Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party .
Yet she could not bear this silence .
happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more !-- And you , ye well - known trees !-- but you will continue the same .-- No leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer !-- No ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade !-- But who will remain to enjoy you ?"
I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever .
No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head .
Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action , but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward , that she acknowledged it with hesitation ; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it .
In another moment a happier sight caught her ;-- Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set !-- Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant .
_Her_ change was equal .-- This one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust .-- On his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of Frank Churchill .-- He had been in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other .
At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I DID find her .
But while she wondered at the difference of the two young men , she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one , put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other .
Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax ' s situation in life .
You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry ' s great attention .
Can not we be gone to - morrow ?"
One is so fenced and guarded from the weather , that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted .
He must love somebody .
When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for ."
Have you finished it ?
Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross , to learn that a removal from one set of people to another , though at a distance of only three miles , will often include a total change of conversation , opinion , and idea .
There is no comparison between them .
I want your interest with him .
Let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour .-- Hush !-- You remember those lines -- I forget the poem at this moment :
" Certainly : Captain Benwick ."
They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable , when another lucky stop in Marianne ' s performance brought her these words in the Colonel ' s calm voice ,--
In Colonel Brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion .
She hardly wished to have more leisure for them .
And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you ."
They were interrupted by the servant ' s coming in to announce the carriage being at the door ; and Mrs . Jennings immediately preparing to go , said ,--
It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them ."
But -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him !-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind !-- look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her !-- It was most provoking .
Sir Walter , indeed , though he had no affection for Anne , and no vanity flattered , to make him really happy on the occasion , was very far from thinking it a bad match for her .
Her manners , too -- and Mr . Elton ' s , were unpleasant towards Harriet .
Her affection must have overpowered her judgment ."
said she , in a low and disappointed voice , as she turned away to the window .
She was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor Isabella , and poor Miss Taylor .-- But it would not do .
But Mr . Woodhouse -- how was Mr . Woodhouse to be induced to consent ?-- he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event .
Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr . Knightley , than with Frank Churchill ?
" Not till the first week of August , when he came home from the Cape , just made into the Grappler .
I certainly get better and better .-- Now for it ."
He had walked up one day after dinner , as he very often did , to spend his evening at Hartfield .
She left it to himself to recollect , that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty , with little to live on , and no surname of dignity .
After that , I suppose , I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex , and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it , were no better than these :-- The danger is my own ; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself ."
Within a fortnight .
no -- I would get you a better partner than myself .
" Oh !"
This is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying .
Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection -- but I need not explain myself farther ," he added , looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye --" your particular intimacy -- you have probably heard the whole story long ago ."
You need not be afraid , Miss Elliot , of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected ."
Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness ; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying --
" A woman of seven and twenty ," said Marianne , after pausing a moment , " can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife .
I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove .
She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion .
Miss Woodhouse !
Emma , in the meanwhile , could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons .
He had not time to enter into much explanation .
But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices , and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do ."
Her making a fourth , when they sat down to dinner , was noticed as an advantage .
But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess .
" Quite the contrary ," replied Elinor , looking expressively at Marianne .
" My dear Mrs .
Mrs . Dashwood feared to hazard any remark , and ventured not to offer consolation .
cried Marianne , her eyes sparkling with animation , and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness .
That has been a very great improvement .
He was immediately interested .
Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold .
Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother .
He stays till to - morrow , and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us .-- They are coming in , I hope ."
She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth .
How will a conundrum reckon ?"
" Nonsense !
I shall never forget his flying Henry ' s kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o ' clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence .-- If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor ."
I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed .
" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time ."
Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .
It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction ; for , more than once before , beginning with the observation of " your sister looks unwell to - day ," or " your sister seems out of spirits ," he had appeared on the point , either of disclosing , or of inquiring , something particular about her .
The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma , in a note from Mrs . Weston , instantly .
" Oh dear !"
Not that you have any reason to regret , my dear Elinor .
For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am ."
Elinor saw , with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend .
At her time of life , any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever !
You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent -- some of it , at least -- my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books ."
But Mr . Elton , in person , had driven away all such cares .
Then , remembering Colonel Brandon , reproved herself , felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival ' s , the reward of her sister was due , and wished any thing rather than Mrs . Willoughby ' s death .
" This is a pleasure ," said he , in rather a low voice , " coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated .
What a thinking brain you have !
Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion .
She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this moment -- _his_ favourite ."
But neither Charles Hayter ' s feelings , nor anybody ' s feelings , could interest her , till she had a little better arranged her own .
Elinor , confirmed in every pleasant hope , was all cheerfulness ; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother , she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend ' s , in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland ; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel .
I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill - used man ."
Shall we walk , Augusta ?"
" I should have been sorry , Mr . Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr . Woodhouse ' s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body .
Instead of talking of Edward , they came gradually to talk only of Robert ,-- a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other , and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own ; and in short , it became speedily evident to both , that he had entirely supplanted his brother .
Mrs . Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession .
I had no reason to believe her of less authority now .
He stopped .
One question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome .
" Yes , yes -- but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings .
" Ah !
He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all !-- You must let me read it to him ."
" I was at Norland about a month ago ."
