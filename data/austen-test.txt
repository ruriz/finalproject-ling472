We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it .
The children are all fond of him ."
But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again , so near as town .
The others had been talking of the child , Mrs . Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant ' s appearing not quite well .
She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself , and speaking familiarly to her brother ; and had just determined to find out his name from the latter , when they both came towards her , and Mr . Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr . Robert Ferrars .
Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot ' s failure , but from the perception of there being a somebody else .
I will say that for you ."
That Louisa must remain where she was , however distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble , did not admit a doubt .
No indeed !-- There was not a hint of Mr . Martin .
I wish you may receive this in time to come here to - night , but I will not depend on it .
There was no immediate appearance .
He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged Miss Fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more .
yes "-- he replied ; " I was just going to mention it .
Isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great .
My peace of mind is doubly involved in it ;-- for not only is it horrible to suspect a person , who has been what HE has been to ME , of such designs ,-- but what must it make me appear to myself ?-- What in a situation like mine , but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to "--
She wished very much to have the subject continued , though she did not chuse to join in it herself ; but nothing more of it was said , and for the first time in her life , she thought Mrs . Jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information , or in a disposition to communicate it .
John Knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , " I could not have believed it even of _him_ ."
and very much to the purpose .
" One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby ' s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams .
Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing ; but the age of emotion she certainly had not .
Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr . Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself ;-- and two basins only were ordered .
She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr . and Mrs . Weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring .
She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was ."
" I have not a fault to find with her person ," he replied .
Very odd indeed !"
The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , " Hum !
" His aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them ."-- Mrs .
Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .
Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr . Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell ."
And who but Mr . Knightley could know and bear with Mr . Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable !-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr . Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband ' s plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma .
A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows .
Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps .
And without farther ceremony , she turned away and walked to the instrument .
Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened !"
She understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will .
I heard it from the servant .
Pray , pray let me hear it ."
Her apprehensions once raised , paid by their excess for all her former security ; and the servant who sat up with her , for she would not allow Mrs . Jennings to be called , only tortured her more , by hints of what her mistress had always thought .
" It is a sort of thing ," cried Mrs . Elton emphatically , " which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into .
She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs . Goddard chose to tell her ; and looked no farther .
" Well , my dear Penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him .
Mrs . Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .
It was , perhaps , one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides ; and for myself , I certainly never should , in any circumstance of tolerable similarity , give such advice .
She merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly .
" I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly .
I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking - glasses from my dressing - room , which was your father ' s .
I am sure I must have been as white as my gown .
She is very fond of Frank , and therefore I would not speak ill of her .
However , I got a very good husband , and I don ' t know what the greatest beauty can do more .
Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault .
Two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there , not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery , but all over the grounds , and especially in the most distant parts of them , where there was something more of wildness than in the rest , where the trees were the oldest , and the grass was the longest and wettest , had -- assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings -- given Marianne a cold so violent as , though for a day or two trifled with or denied , would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body , and the notice of herself .
I have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me .
He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes ."
" Indeed you did .
His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , " Can this be Mr Elliot ?"
Oh !
" I went only to the post - office ," said she , " and reached home before the rain was much .
" Rather say your mother ' s imprudence , my child ," said Mrs . Dashwood ; " SHE must be answerable ."
Making - up indeed would not do .
It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood .
do come in .
Dear me , how clever !-- Could it really be meant for me ?"
Emma allowed her father to talk -- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy .
" Exert yourself , dear Marianne ," she cried , " if you would not kill yourself and all who love you .
for of course you must know , as you have been in Devonshire so lately .'"
" Law , my dear !
Mrs . Dashwood ' s visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day , and two of her daughters went with her ; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party , under some trifling pretext of employment ; and her mother , who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent , was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home .
cried Emma , not attending to her .--" Mrs .
My charge would be much more concise than her ' s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them ."
" We think so very differently on this point , Mr . Knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it .
All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the Eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending .
At last the affair was decided .
She opened the packet ; it was too surely so ;-- a note from Mrs . Weston to herself , ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs . Weston .
Chapter 22
My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother -- will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard -- nothing but an earnest desire of being useful -- I think I am justified -- though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ?"
If _we_ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations .
The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr .
" Oh yes , papa .
When he came back , alas !
She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information .
And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother ' s old petticoat .
That would have been too dreadful !-- What an escape !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world ."
Margaret ' s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister .
" I might not like them the better for that perhaps .
Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions .
This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating .
I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet .
Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in , they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired ; it would save her a full mile , and they were going through Uppercross .
Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne ' s known wishes .
She did not attribute guile to any .
However , it was an exceeding good , pretty letter , and gave Mr . and Mrs . Weston a great deal of pleasure .
" On this point we have been wretched .
How was she to bear the change ?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .
Come , come , this won ' t do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it ."
I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature .
" Ah !
who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near !
He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
This proves that he can leave the Churchills ."
Elinor read and returned it without any comment .
It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach Admiral Baldwin ' s age ."
After winding along it for more than a mile , they reached their own house .
She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention .
We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before .
But you are too good for that , I am sure ."
It was in one of these short meetings , each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants , that she said --
" That is the woman I want ," said he .
" They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox .
" Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and --"
Henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father .
You may imagine how desirable !
But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him ."
That was a great deal too smart for me .
Why was not she to be as useful as Anne ?
In the mean while she was in the carriage .
He stood as opposed to Captain Wentworth , in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness ; and the evil of his attentions last night , the irremediable mischief he might have done , was considered with sensations unqualified , unperplexed .
Strangers filling their place !"
CHAPTER X
" What is the matter ?"
She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell .
Elton ."
The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot : Louisa returned ; and Mary , finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge - row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound , Mary was happy no longer ; she quarrelled with her own seat , was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere , and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also .
Had Mrs . Dashwood , like her daughter , heard Willoughby ' s story from himself -- had she witnessed his distress , and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater .
A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings !
She will not even listen to your questions .
It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable ."
She acknowledged , therefore , that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other , of their mutual affection she had no doubt , and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear .
A butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage - house within a stone ' s throw .
Mrs Smith !
But the resolution was made only to be broken .
Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please ; she will now have but one .
My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding .
Harriet really wished , and had wished some time , to consult a dentist .
Marianne , though without knowing it herself , reaped all its advantage ; for neither Mrs . Jennings , nor Sir John , nor even Mrs . Palmer herself , ever spoke of him before her .
But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to .
He would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry .
At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so .
--
He had , probably , never heard , and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter .
She liked him , however , upon the whole , much better than she had expected , and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more ;-- not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism , his selfishness , and his conceit , to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward ' s generous temper , simple taste , and diffident feelings .
Chapter 18
And how beautiful we thought he looked !
She was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing -- the art of pleasing , at least , at Kellynch Hall ; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot , as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that Lady Russell , who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve .
" Well , my dear ," he deliberately began , " considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you .
They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose .
came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs . Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world ;-- so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs . Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again .
" The smallness of the house ," said she , " I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income ."
If Jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on Mrs . Elton ' s side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects : The post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of Mrs . Elton ' s meditated activity .
Once Lucy thought to write to him , but then her spirits rose against that .
The late owner of this estate was a single man , who lived to a very advanced age , and who for many years of his life , had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister .
" I shall be very glad to look it over ," said he ; " but it seems long .
Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward .
The next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat ;-- and they were all seated and busy , and still Frank Churchill did not come .
Woodhouse ?-- I am so glad .-- Quite out of my power .-- Such a happy little circle as you find us here .-- Yes , indeed .-- Charming young man !-- that is -- so very friendly ; I mean good Mr .
continued Harriet --" these two last !-- But how shall I ever be able to return the paper , or say I have found it out ?-- Oh !
They gaily ascended the downs , rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky ; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south - westerly wind , they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations .
" No , ma ' am , he did not mention no particular family ; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman , and would be a baronight some day ."
They reached town by three o ' clock the third day , glad to be released , after such a journey , from the confinement of a carriage , and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire .
" Emma !"
Marianne ' s abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to Elinor ' s .
A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her ."
I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other .
When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , Queen Mab shall receive you ."
" Why , really , dear Emma , I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _not_ being in love with her , that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last .
I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now .
" So altered that he should not have known her again !"
" There is no quarrelling with you .
She wanted her to be more known .
I think we must get him to Bath .
I love him already ."
You talk of being proud ; I am called proud , I know , and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise ; for our pride , if investigated , would have the same object , I have no doubt , though the kind may seem a little different .
They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward .
Lady Middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one ' s attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished .
She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary agitation , in their morning discourse , must have left at least doubtful .
I have another person ' s interest at present so much at heart , that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill .
Of the lady , individually , Emma thought very little .
He will be here in a moment , I am sure ."
To Elinor , the observation of the latter was particularly grateful .
" Poor comfort !"
--
Harriet Smith ' s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing .
I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly .
It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect .
" Me !
So unlike what a man should be !-- None of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life ."
" Nay , Mamma , if he is not to be animated by Cowper !-- but we must allow for difference of taste .
She had learnt , in the last ten minutes , more of his feelings towards Louisa , more of all his feelings than she dared to think of ; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party , to the needful civilities of the moment , with exquisite , though agitated sensations .
But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me .
This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist ; she said , therefore , " I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth ' s letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy .
To be sure , the charade , with its " ready wit "-- but then the " soft eyes "-- in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth .
" Yes .
This made a difficulty .
" I saw her answer !-- nothing could be clearer ."
This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference -- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying )-- the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance .
On the contrary , I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr . Elton as a model .
But , alas !
I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue .
The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs . Jennings ' s acquaintance to inform them of her being in town ; and Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind , watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air .
" Indeed !-- that must be a very great pleasure ."
A very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in England ."
And Mr . Weston at the same time , walking briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling out ,
She dared not look up ;-- but her mother and Marianne both turned their eyes on him .
There is no hurry at all .
It has been , it is a most cruel affliction .
" You are so noble in your ideas !"
You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her .
The evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us .
" Miss Woodhouse ," said Frank Churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , " have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ?
I do not see it ."
Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me .
yes .
those letters are convenient passports .
Emma ' s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr . Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation .
Do you know it ?-- Cramer .-- And here are a new set of Irish melodies .
She remained in her seat , and so did Lady Russell ; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot ; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on Lady Russell ' s account , to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth , if he gave her the opportunity .
" Oh !
It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith ' s ."
But I did not love only him ;-- and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt .
They had an early account from Lyme the next morning .
It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings , with half a heart .
" What a great traveller you must have been , ma ' am !"
My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation ."
Anxious to omit no possible precaution , Anne struggled , and said --
She could not refuse to give him hers ' s ;-- he pressed it with affection .
It was not Lucy ' s business to put herself forward , and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up .
" Had I known as much half an hour ago -- But since I AM here ,"-- speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat --" what does it signify ?-- For once , Miss Dashwood -- it will be the last time , perhaps -- let us be cheerful together .-- I am in a fine mood for gaiety .-- Tell me honestly "-- a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks -- " do you think me most a knave or a fool ?"
We may well say that ` our lot is cast in a goodly heritage .'
" Indeed !-- from Yorkshire , I think .
can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me ?-- Absurd and insufferable !"
He comes to Highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at Ford ' s .
And I am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all ."
At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said --
I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive .
He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time .
The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost .-- But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction .
Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation ; and by changing the subject , put a stop to her entreaties .
He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed .-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ?
He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it ."
They all walked about together , to see that every thing was as it should be ; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage , which Emma could not hear the sound of at first , without great surprize .
I lay no embargo on any body ' s words .
To satisfy me , those characters must be united .
Such a number of looking - glasses !
Jane Fairfax was an orphan , the only child of Mrs . Bates ' s youngest daughter .
Mrs . Jennings , who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking , and who expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood ' s communication , in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon ' s side , as might have become a man in the bloom of youth , of hope and happiness , saw him , with amazement , remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual .
He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her .-- Emma saw it .
Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance , and their visit in general .
Her wretchedness I could have borne , but her passion -- her malice -- At all events it must be appeased .
Mrs . Jennings , in the meantime , talked on as loud as she could , and continued her account of their surprise , the evening before , on seeing their friends , without ceasing till every thing was told .
And so , just as he was going away again , it came into my head , I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it , but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news .
Again they were both silent .
He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him ."
So afraid you might have a headache !-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have .
Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ?
Anne replied , and spoke in defence of the performance so well , and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly , that his countenance improved , and he replied again with almost a smile .
" This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing ' s being dull and insipid about the house !-- I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not -- for a few weeks at least .
I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least ."
" This would soon have led to something better , of course ," was her consoling reflection ; " any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart .
My card was not lost , I hope ."
Knightley is quite the gentleman .
How few people know what comfort is !
Would you , in short , have renewed the engagement then ?"
" Yes , papa , it is written out in our second page .
Cold - hearted Elinor !
She expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own , and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself .
I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve ."
However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs . Bates too , in a different way .
" If I can come again , we are still to have our ball .
" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared .-- I wish our opinions were the same .
Tell me not that I am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever .
" Oh dear , yes ; I know him extremely well ," replied Mrs . Palmer ;--" Not that I ever spoke to him , indeed ; but I have seen him for ever in town .
It made her animated -- open hearted -- she voluntarily said ;--
Nature gave you understanding :-- Miss Taylor gave you principles .
" They are very pretty , ma ' am -- an ' t they ?"
Well , what do you say to it ?-- I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I ?-- Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me ?-- In town next week , you see -- at the latest , I dare say ; for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday .
said she , quickly , looking up in his face .
" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- We have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well .
" You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs . and Miss Bates ," said Emma , " I have not heard one inquiry after them ."
Four bed - rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house .
He must love her .
" That is very likely .
She is as low as possible .
He listened in perfect silence .
It was as much , however , as was desired , and more than was expected , by Edward and Elinor ; and Mrs . Ferrars herself , by her shuffling excuses , seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more .
They will read together .
Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary , indeed , and that she had not a syllable to say for him .
Lady Russell said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself !-- she believed , in short , what Anne did not believe .
How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation ?-- Emma , I had not thought it possible ."
Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs . Ferrars ' s heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children ."
" No ; considering our situation , it was not strange .
And Frank Churchill was heard to say , " I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling .
" And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking !-- I do not know when I have been so disappointed ."
She had no longer any inclination to talk to him .
Again I demand an explanation of it .
He did not speak , he did not behave like himself .
And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person .
Edward , who had till then looked any where , rather than at her , saw her hurry away , and perhaps saw -- or even heard , her emotion ; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie , which no remarks , no inquiries , no affectionate address of Mrs . Dashwood could penetrate , and at last , without saying a word , quitted the room , and walked out towards the village -- leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation , so wonderful and so sudden ;-- a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures .
Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate .-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke .
She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself .
For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ?"
On the contrary it was a relief to her , to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them , and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward , which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself , and which was more than she felt equal to support .
" We are never safe from HIM ."
There were Mr . and Mrs . Weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect .
One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell , and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys ; and another might predict disagreements among their servants ; but yet , upon the whole , there was no serious objection raised , except in one habitation , the Vicarage .-- There , the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction .
much thicker than Miss Anne ' s ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already , and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal , that his cousin Anne ' s boots were rather the thickest .
I should not have used the expression .
Knightley .-- Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter .-- They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry ;-- it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion .-- He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found .
-- Harriet ' s was --
It did not appear to me that -- in short , you know , Dr Shirley must have a curate , and you had secured his promise .
" That is what you have in your head , I know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by ."
" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ ," said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , " the person has not chosen ill .
and so forth -- I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see .
She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert ' s marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her ."
She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment .
" Poor Jane Fairfax !"
" Yes , that he will !"
Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well .
Mr . Elton then turned back to accompany them .
The young ladies arrived : their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable .
The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe .
I wish his friends would propose it to him .
She feared it was a strengthening regard .
" Dear me !
" I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon .
You will tell me , I know , that this may or may NOT have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this .
She complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street .
I feel it so very due .
A _Mrs . _ _Elton_ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse ; former intimacy might sink without remark .
Mr . Knightley , is not she ?"
Edward saw enough to comprehend , not only the meaning of others , but such of Marianne ' s expressions as had puzzled him before ; and when their visitors left them , he went immediately round her , and said , in a whisper , " I have been guessing .
Captain Wentworth , with five - and - twenty thousand pounds , and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him , was no longer nobody .
You know James Benwick ."
" If she is really ill , why not go to Bath , Mr .
Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse .-- Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in .
" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs . Jennings ' s heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence ."
Mr . Weston directed the whole , officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage , and every body was in good time .
Mr . Woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life ."
They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring ; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long , when they saw him coming after them , with three companions , all well known already , by description , to be Captain and Mrs Harville , and a Captain Benwick , who was staying with them .
He brought all the music to her , and they looked it over together .-- Emma took the opportunity of whispering ,
No letter from Willoughby came ; and none seemed expected by Marianne .
She had seen him .
" Lord !
" I am ready ," said Emma , " whenever I am wanted ."
said Emma .
" Such attentions as Mrs . Elton ' s , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax .
Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited .
How cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are !"
Presently Mr . Knightley looked back , and came and sat down by her .
CHAPTER XIV
The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton .
Her sensibility was potent enough !
Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family , which was generally , as Anne very well knew , the least to blame .
" I confess ," replied Elinor , " that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement ; but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other ."
"' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here .
One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning .
A variety of occupations , of objects , and of company , which could not be procured at Barton , would be inevitable there , and might yet , she hoped , cheat Marianne , at times , into some interest beyond herself , and even into some amusement , much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her .
you are not serious now .
Harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody -- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend .
" I do not often walk this way _now_ ," said Emma , as they proceeded , " but _then_ there will be an inducement , and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of Highbury ."
" I cannot make speeches , Emma :" he soon resumed ; and in a tone of such sincere , decided , intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing .--" If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more .
But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment ' s uneasiness can ever occur between us again .
In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness ;-- to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her ;-- and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality .-- These were great concessions ;-- but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make .
" I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition ," said Edward .--" For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU in former days .-- In a sister it is bad enough , but in a wife !-- how I have blushed over the pages of her writing !-- and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish -- business -- this is the only letter I ever received from her , of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style ."
What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing .
But Mrs . Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration .
How little did I think !-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured .
As her eyes fell on him , his seemed to be withdrawn from her .
I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you ."
" Good or bad ?"
He soon quitted Bath ; and on Mrs Clay ' s quitting it soon afterwards , and being next heard of as established under his protection in London , it was evident how double a game he had been playing , and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman , at least .
Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered : it was enough -- HE was not there -- and she sat down , equally ill - disposed to receive or communicate pleasure .
She has plenty of money , and I intend she shall buy all the high - priced things I have in hand now ."
If you will have such ideas !
They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .
She was not a woman of many words ; for , unlike people in general , she proportioned them to the number of her ideas ; and of the few syllables that did escape her , not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood , whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events .
Like other great men under reverses ," he added , with a smile .
I have nothing to do with William ' s wants , but it really is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose ."
Marianne coloured as she replied , " But most people do ."
" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done .
Quite worn out and broken up .
The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms .
replied Emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint .
She is still nearer .-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body .
" But , upon my soul , I did NOT know it ," he warmly replied ; " I did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction ; and common sense might have told her how to find it out ."
The tenderest caresses followed this confession .
Where could have been the attraction ?
" It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs . Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr . Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister .
MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature .
Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard .
There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are .
No , I have no idea of being so easily persuaded .
" She has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed ."
" There is my news :-- I thought it would interest you ," said Mr . Knightley , with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them .
Troubles soon arose .
Mrs . Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole .
" What !
I have been always telling you , my love , that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended ; and now you have Emma ' s account , I hope you will be satisfied ."
I have no patience with him .
What else can detain him at Norland ?"
CHAPTER 14
" Oh !
" But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it .-- I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do .
" I would do more than for my own .
Their union , she believed , could not divide her more from other men , than their final separation .
And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .
" We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft ' s here soon ; I dare say you know him by name ."
Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley : she was at a window , looking out for Captain Wentworth ; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give , and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation .
Henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as Mary wished ; but " No !"
Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married ."
Elinor tried to make a civil answer , though doubting her own success .
What a pity it is that Mr . Weston ever thought of her !"
" Oh !
Charles , if you see Captain Harville anywhere , remember to give Miss Anne ' s message .
and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ?"
With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them , they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living , but the readiness of the house , to which Colonel Brandon , with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor , was making considerable improvements ; and after waiting some time for their completion , after experiencing , as usual , a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen , Elinor , as usual , broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready , and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn .
Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love .
" Oh no !
no , that must have been quite accidental .
Mrs . Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford ; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest , though rather more liberal than what John had expressed .
Many circumstances assisted the temptation .
I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- Candles everywhere .-- I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane ,-- There was a little disappointment .-- The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr . Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again .
His card was on the table when they came in from the morning ' s drive .
Well , ( returning to the room ,) I have not been able to succeed .
Mr . Elton was so hot and tired , that all this wit seemed thrown away .
A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood ."
yes , perhaps , it had been Mr Elliot .
I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this .
" Upon my word ," she cried , " the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking .
how very odd !
Anne ' s astonished air , and exclamation of wonder , made her pause , and in a calmer manner , she added ,
Ten minutes were enough to certify that .
The girls were now hunting for the Laconia ; and Captain Wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble , and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate , and present non - commissioned class , observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had .
She must understand you ."
She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for Emma ' s attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs . Weston ended with , " We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come ," she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .
CHARADE .
" You are very much mistaken .
" Indeed , Marianne , I think you are mistaken .
If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else ."
" It is not now worth a regret ," said Emma .
" We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor ' s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor ' s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure .
To understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour .
Here , however , Elinor perceived ,-- not the language , not the professions of Colonel Brandon , but the natural embellishments of her mother ' s active fancy , which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose .
It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement .
To the former her raillery was probably , as far as it regarded only himself , perfectly indifferent ; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible ; and when its object was understood , she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity , or censure its impertinence , for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel ' s advanced years , and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor .
" That he is patronised by YOU ," replied Willoughby , " is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself .
Captain Benwick is very well , I believe , but he is a very odd young man .
" Well ," said she , " and you soon silenced Mr . Cole , I suppose ?"
" Thank you .
All the better .
I assure you I heard of it in my way through town ."
When he was speaking of it in that way , I honestly said that _the_ _world_ I could give up -- parties , balls , plays -- for I had no fear of retirement .
We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife ."
Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour .
" This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot ' s life ," said Anne , " which has always excited my particular curiosity .
On THAT head , therefore , it was not for her to oppose her mother ' s intention of removing into Devonshire .
If it were war now , he would have settled it long ago .
They spoke , therefore , of Mrs . Churchill ' s death with mutual forbearance .
Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father ' s house in Camden Place , or her own sister ' s intimacy with Mrs Clay .
" Something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps ."
Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits .
The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills , and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows .
Miss Dashwood , at this point , turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt , stopped him , by saying ,
Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story .
" Miss Elliot ," said he , speaking rather low , " you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much .
She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith ' s .
Mrs . Dashwood was sorry for what she had said ; but it gave Elinor pleasure , as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions .
" I do not pretend to fix on times or places , but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage ."
and the two new beauties , with the tall Irish officer , who is talked of for one of them ."
His understanding was good , and his education had given it solid improvement .
Selina is no fine lady , I assure you .
He meant not to be unkind , however , and , as a mark of his affection for the three girls , he left them a thousand pounds a - piece .
I am sure you will like it of all things .
or a shark ?
And on my own account too -- so dear as he is to me -- I don ' t think I could be equal to it .
' My dear Madam ,' I always say to her , ' you must make yourself easy .
They were speaking as they drew near .
You must be the best judge of your own happiness .
You shall have a charming wife ."
It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter .
" I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward ," she cried .
Sir Walter , his two daughters , and Mrs Clay , were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening ; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for , they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room .
It was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness .
The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so .-- Harriet ' s parentage became known .
I am all amazement !
" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ?"
I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs !"
It is like a woman ' s writing ."
It is early ."
So far all was perfectly right ; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan , when it burst on her , which was , Mrs Clay ' s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth , as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her .
How could I look on without agony ?
" Service !
Within a few days after this meeting , the newspapers announced to the world , that the lady of Thomas Palmer , Esq .
I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth .
asked Elinor .
And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure .
It was a palpable display , repeated on every possible occasion .
They were of sobering tendency ; they allayed agitation ; they composed , and consequently must make her happier .
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced .
It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .
She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved .
" But what are you in doubt of ?
Compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent .
" You may believe how glad we all were to see them ," added Mrs . Jennings , leaning forward towards Elinor , and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else , though they were seated on different sides of the room ; " but , however , I can ' t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation .
But you ,-- you above all , above my mother , had been wronged by me .
There had been no real affection either in his language or manners .
Is it impossible to -?
It was all my doing , I know .
" At any rate ," said Elinor , wishing to prevent Mrs . Jennings from seeing her sister ' s thoughts as clearly as she did , " I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week ."
The anxious cares , the incessant attentions of Mrs . Weston , were not thrown away .
His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth , and there being no sufficient reason against it , he ought to go ; and it ended in his making a bold , public declaration , when he came in from shooting , of his meaning to dress directly , and dine at the other house .
It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk .
Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland ."
Witness this very time .
Elton .-- She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr . Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife .
" But you will come again ," said Emma .
We were asked on purpose to be introduced .
She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved .
This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs . John Dashwood , a gentleman - like and pleasing young man , who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister ' s establishment at Norland , and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there .
And he is a very clever boy , indeed .
Has Perry seen her ?
This wretched note was the finale of Emma ' s breakfast .
replied Lucy ; " I wonder at that , for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes .
" Yes , yes , to the inn ," repeated Captain Wentworth , comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something .
I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm .
If you want any farther explanation ," continued he , smiling , " they are paid for it .
Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three .
" For God ' s sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ?"
" What !
I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this .-- I should have had no confidence , no esteem .
My dear sir , you are too obliging .-- Is there nobody you would not rather ?-- I am not helpless .
" Colonel Brandon ' s character ," said Elinor , " as an excellent man , is well established ."
I dare say Mr . Knightley will be so kind as to meet him ."
CHAPTER XIX
He was recalled from wit to wisdom , not by any reproof of her ' s , but by his own sensibility .
The Admiral ' s kind urgency came in support of his wife ' s ; they would not be refused ; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner , and Captain Wentworth , without saying a word , turned to her , and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage .
She could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering ,
" And who do you think came in while we were there ?"
Do look at it .
" I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr . Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity .
Chapter 8
The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied .
She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say , and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first .
For a moment or two nothing was said , and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , till she found her arm drawn within his , and pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying , in a tone of great sensibility , speaking low ,
She took them all most affectionately by the hand , and expressed great delight in seeing them again .
He saw that Emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , " Nonsense !
."
She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause .
" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report .
Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father .
I can hardly believe it .-- I thought I knew him ."
I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question .
If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice ; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish .
" But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister ?-- I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful ."
He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father ' s house , only two miles from Uppercross .
They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party , from which Mrs . Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter ; and for this party , Marianne , wholly dispirited , careless of her appearance , and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid , prepared , without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure .
She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work '-- don ' t you , ma ' am ?-- And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her -- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word .
" When did that happen ?"
She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed , which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration .
What a disappointment it would be !
We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down , and see how the children go on ; we will walk to Sir John ' s new plantations at Barton Cross , and the Abbeyland ; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory , and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached .
" No , I do not know that Mr . Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except --
But -- it was NOT Colonel Brandon -- neither his air -- nor his height .
She played and sang ;-- and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of .
But as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer .
Either in the morning or evening of every day , excepting one , have we seen either Mr . Weston or Mrs . Weston , and generally both , either at Randalls or here -- and as you may suppose , Isabella , most frequently here .
" But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles .
" I am glad of it .
And how he had been so worried by what passed , that as soon as he had went away from his mother ' s house , he had got upon his horse , and rid into the country , some where or other ; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday , on purpose to get the better of it .
Here Mrs . Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce .
Emma even jumped with surprize ;-- and , horror - struck , exclaimed ,
He could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body ' s returning into their proper place the next morning .
Sir John could do no more ; but he did not know that any more was required : to be together was , in his opinion , to be intimate , and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual , he had not a doubt of their being established friends .
I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with .
But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain .
If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again , she fancied she should be satisfied ; and as to the power of addressing him , she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred .
" Nay ," said Anne , " I have no particular enquiry to make about her .
But it shall be regulated , it shall be checked by religion , by reason , by constant employment ."
" Oh , Mrs . Churchill ; every body knows Mrs . Churchill ," replied Isabella : " and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion .
You had rather take evil upon credit than good .
He could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful .
" How unlucky that is !
But when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , Lord bless you !
How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ?
This is always my luck .
The two grandmothers , with not less partiality , but more sincerity , were equally earnest in support of their own descendant .
I will attack them with more address .
you are too scrupulous , indeed you are ," cried Emma warmly , and taking her hand .
To Marianne , he merely bowed and said nothing .
THAT I will never consent to .
We are so very airy !
She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed .
Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once , when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again .
She could not have called it either cold or friendly , or anything so certainly as embarrassed .
worse than cold - hearted !
She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _alone_ , and that you know --( nodding towards her father )-- Humph !-- Can you come ?"
Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment .
They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother ' s place , but without a mother ' s affection to blind her .
Mrs . Jennings soon appeared , and the note being given her , she read it aloud .
But they have a great many to provide for ; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not , it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed ."
" Yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays .
" Remember , Elinor ," said she , " how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it .
" Oh !"
There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury ; but one interest -- one object of curiosity ; it will be all Mr . Frank Churchill ; we shall think and speak of nobody else ."
Does Mrs . Churchill do the same ?"
I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama .
I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit .
" Oh !
Does she never mean to go away ?
" So early too !
Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs . Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy .-- She had some fears of his horse .
Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season ."
You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ?"
He was delighted with every thing ; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr . Woodhouse ' s ear ; and when their going farther was resolved on , confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village , and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed .
Jane , don ' t you remember grandmama ' s telling us of it when we got home ?
She tried to be calm , and leave things to take their course , and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence :-- " Surely , if there be constant attachment on each side , our hearts must understand each other ere long .
Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last .
Conversation however was not wanted , for Sir John was very chatty , and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home .
Without scruple -- without apology -- without much apparent diffidence , Mr . Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _her_ lover .
We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know .
Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him .
" That is as formidable an image as you could present , Harriet ; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates !
There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well -- quite as well , or better , perhaps , all things considered .
However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr . Knightley too , to take care of her , I cannot wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy ."
Mrs . Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of .
Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear ."
" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out .
" With all my heart .
She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot , and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , who were fortunately already engaged to come ; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention .
Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage .
Young ladies should take care of themselves .-- Young ladies are delicate plants .
Every body must have seen the snow coming on .
The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton !
They were now approaching the cottage , and all idle topics were superseded .
She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .
Their time and strength , and spirits , were , therefore , exactly ready for this walk , and they entered into it with pleasure .
Edward was , of course , immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy ' s conduct , nor more self - evident than the motive of it .
You pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right ."
Look at her .
It was no insignificant barrier , indeed .
Mrs . Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied .
Anne was startled and confused ; but after standing in a moment ' s suspense , was obliged , and not sorry to be obliged , to hurry away .
The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration .
In one respect he is the object of my envy ."
And yet it is not very unlikely ."
How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both .
" How often did I wish ," added he , " when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth , that Barton cottage were inhabited !
I cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance .
At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware .
I detest jargon of every kind , and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself , because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning ."
Give me the book , I will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you ."
The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind .
I brought her into Plymouth ; and here another instance of luck .
How very odd !
-- She was stopped by a cough .
It chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne ' s .
She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction ."
she cried with a most open eagerness --" Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me .
" He longed to see her .
He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that I might see it ; and if I do not turn back now , I have no chance .
Such a heart is very little worth having ; is it , Lady Russell ?
As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse .-- In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ' s native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ?
Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now .-- ` You must go ,' said she .
Soon after this Miss Bates came in , and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing .
She insisted on being left behind , the next morning , when the others went out .
" How very pleasing and proper of him !"
The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay ; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits , and make her believe , as she THEN really believed herself , that it would be a very short one .
" What can it be , Miss Woodhouse ?-- what can it be ?
it would be a capital match for either of his sisters ."
It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ), as well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent -- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise , Emma would not interfere with .
No , the young lady , to be sure .
But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her ."
" A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer !"
He addressed her with easy civility , and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done , that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy .
Miss Dashwood , do you think people make love when any body else is by ?
Do you really think it a bad thing ?-- why so ?"
" And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure ."
Mrs . John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr . Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care .-- When it was thus settled on her sister ' s side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable .-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr . Woodhouse ' s carriage .-- It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .
Beyond it she would on no account proceed .
Marianne was vexed at it for her sister ' s sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs . Jennings ' s .
But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied , she could not reflect on the mean - spirited folly from which it sprung , nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance , without thoroughly despising them all four .
It was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .
Mrs . Weston would be at ease .
After this had been settled , Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour , and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret , that the house was small and indifferent ;-- an evil which Elinor , as Mrs . Jennings had supposed her to do , made very light of , at least as far as regarded its size .
.
Shall I call upon them ?
But do come in .
Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon ' s injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate .
' But how can it be done ?'
Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do .
It was an afternoon of distress , and Anne had every thing to do at once ; the apothecary to send for , the father to have pursued and informed , the mother to support and keep from hysterics , the servants to control , the youngest child to banish , and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe ; besides sending , as soon as she recollected it , proper notice to the other house , which brought her an accession rather of frightened , enquiring companions , than of very useful assistants .
I have thought only of you .
He rose up , and walked across the room .
Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of " a charming woman ," because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody .
Charles , ring and order a chair .
They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself .
They were all in high spirits and good humour , eager to be happy , and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise .
It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came .
Such an adventure as this ,-- a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way , could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain .
She rated Lady Russell ' s influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self - denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation .
He made no reply ; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned ; but as if , on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking , he felt the necessity of instant exertion , he recovered himself again , and after saying , " Yes , I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town , which you were so good as to send me ," turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend .
Understanding and gratification came together .
The name of Walter I can drop , thank God !
" He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner ."
" I wished very much to call upon you yesterday ," said he , " but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs . Ferrars .
" And who is Willoughby ?"
Say ` No ,' if it is to be said ."
Did you ever hear of that ?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard .
She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .
I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs . Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England .
" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ?"
I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none .
The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate .
The purity of her life , the formality of her notions , her ignorance of the world -- every thing was against me .
" You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ," had been repeated many times over .
Such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than Anne could combat .
do you recommend this side ?-- Well , I am sure , Mr . Churchill -- only it seems too good -- but just as you please .
Anne was amused by Henrietta ' s manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta ' s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them .
" You could not have visited me !"
My dear Emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point ."
When the evening was over , Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .
" It is but a cottage ," she continued , " but I hope to see many of my friends in it .
But I shall want the ribbon directly -- so it had better go to Hartfield -- at least the ribbon .
cried Margaret , " how happy I should be !
It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country .-- The Box Hill party had decided him on going away .
said Emma playfully .
She expressly conditioned , however , for paying no visits , and would do no more than accompany them to Gray ' s in Sackville Street , where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old - fashioned jewels of her mother .
I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set .
You forget how time passes ."
I wonder whether it is so .
I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person ."
The invitation was general , and generally declined .
She left it all behind her , all but the recollection that such things had been .
I must love him ; and now that I am satisfied on one point , the one material point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may .
Mrs . Jennings , however , with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her , declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill , and of endeavouring , by her own attentive care , to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from ; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate , desirous to share in all her fatigues , and often by her better experience in nursing , of material use .
As Louisa improved , he had improved , and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week .
As for Lucy Steele , she considered her so totally unamiable , so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man , that she could not be persuaded at first to believe , and afterwards to pardon , any former affection of Edward for her .
Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried .
Emma had hardly expected them : for Mr . Weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm .
" Elinor ," cried Marianne , " is this fair ?
She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride .
To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse ; but the encouragement of his reception , to which every day gave greater kindness , made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible , by Marianne ' s perfect recovery .
The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet ' s welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security .-- What had she to wish for ?
Here is a nut ," said he , catching one down from an upper bough .
But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable !
They were all thoughtless or indolent .
We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man ."
" Two thousand a - year ;" and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity , he added , " Elinor , I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much , for your sake ."
But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon ' s being thirty - five any objection to his marrying HER ."
" We had better move on , Mr . Weston ," said she , " we are detaining the girls ."
She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own Mr . Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr . Perry .
There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct .
" I dare say she had ."
The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins .
" Read it , read it ," said he , " it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma ."
A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur .
But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier -- I think it is most probable -- that something might have been hit on .
Oh !
" To judge from the Colonel ' s spirits , however , you have not yet made him equally sanguine ."
said Mrs . Jennings , without attending to her daughter ' s reproof .
But SHE does every thing well ."
At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived .
He is a most amiable , charming young man , I believe .
" Is Mrs . Ferrars at Longstaple ?"
" Do you call ME happy , Marianne ?
No : the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing , manly , open look , in no respect lessening his personal advantages .
yes , gloves and every thing .
It was but a card party , it was but a mixture of those who had never met before , and those who met too often ; a commonplace business , too numerous for intimacy , too small for variety ; but Anne had never found an evening shorter .
No man and woman , would , probably .
" Can you , ma ' am ?"
He might be only passing through .
Had she tried to speak , or had she been conscious of half Mrs . Jennings ' s well - meant but ill - judged attentions to her , this calmness could not have been maintained ; but not a syllable escaped her lips ; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her .
She seems quite recovered now .
In a low , cautious voice , he said : --
poor fellow !-- sad business for him .-- She was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities .-- How could he be so taken in ?-- Did not think him at all in love -- not in the least .-- Poor Knightley !-- There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him .-- How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him !
There she had listened to Henrietta ' s schemes for Dr Shirley ' s leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen Mr Elliot ; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa , or those who were wrapt up in her welfare .
The evil of a marriage would be much diminished , if Elizabeth were also to marry .
Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife .
Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief .
To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell ' s power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter ' s ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter .
And secretly she added to herself , " Lord bless me !
" Dear Miss Woodhouse !"
Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself .-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to .
After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .
Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection !
" Mr . Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion .
" And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you -- just as I begin to know you ."
We have apple - dumplings , however , very often .
" Yes ," said Mr . John Knightley presently , with some slyness , " he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ."
Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross ; a most decided change .
Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house ; and Louisa , by whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved .
However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again .
Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song , and every thing usual followed .
" So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears !
It shall be a regular party , small , but most elegant ."
" I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you ," said she , " in telling you all this .
She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs . Weston foretold .
continued Mrs . Palmer --" then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose ."
" Has she ?"
I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull ; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart - broken man as Captain Benwick ."
Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance .
Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely .
Knightley must never marry .
Palmer !"
They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more ; and yet perhaps , by " putting the children away in the maid ' s room , or swinging a cot somewhere ," they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides , supposing they might wish to stay ; though , with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove , there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville ' s care entirely .
" Oh !
Her mind returned to Mrs . Elton ' s offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .
After some time spent in saying little or doing less , Lady Middleton sat down to Cassino , and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about , she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs , placed themselves at no great distance from the table .
At this moment I cannot recollect his name , though I have heard it so lately .
" Here , Frederick , you and I part company , I believe ," said she .
Time passed on .
I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune .-- But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith .
" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street ."
But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her , as a proof of friendship , and of deference for her judgement , a great pleasure ; and when it became a sort of parting proof , its value did not lessen .
Mrs . Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures .
" When I have seen Mr . Elton ," replied Jane , " I dare say I shall be interested -- but I believe it requires _that_ with me .
Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still .
We never heard of such things at Maple Grove ."
Nothing should tempt _her_ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father ' s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish .
Well ," ( turning away ), " now , where are you bound ?
Excepting yourself and your brother , I do not know his equal for temper .
Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced .
or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs . Ferrars ' s death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity ?-- Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ?"
They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen , poor little dears !
How long had Mr . Knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ?
are you there ?-- But you are miserably behindhand .
The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon -- or such a companion for her mother ,-- how gratefully was it felt !-- a companion whose judgment would guide , whose attendance must relieve , and whose friendship might soothe her !-- as far as the shock of such a summons COULD be lessened to her , his presence , his manners , his assistance , would lessen it .
Yet as she was convinced that Marianne ' s affection for Willoughby , could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon ' s success , whatever the event of that affection might be , and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure , she thought it most prudent and kind , after some consideration , to say more than she really knew or believed .
The event had every promise of happiness for her friend .
Ferrars ."
She rose early , and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that Mr . Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .
Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you , which said Colonel Wallis , I imagine to be , in himself , a sensible , careful , discerning sort of character ; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife , to whom he tells things which he had better not , and he repeats it all to her .
No invitation came amiss to her .
The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry - tree , the canal , and the yew arbour , would all be made over to HER ; and Mrs . Jennings had , for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs . Ferrars .
You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law ' s family ."
As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes , without taking that liberty , she begged to be excused .
Her intentions were unchanged .
cried Elinor ; " have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ?
Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them , and it was to be done in a quiet , unpretending , elegant way , infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation , the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings .
And I hope she is well ."
But what could I do !-- we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed -- But I am talking like a fool .
After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs . Ferrars , just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring , the reproach of being too amiable , Edward was admitted to her presence , and pronounced to be again her son .
His opinion , however , made some little amends for his delay , for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient , he would not allow the danger to be material , and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure , with a confidence which , in a lesser degree , was communicated to Elinor .
They never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax ' s peace in a thousand instances ; and on Box Hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more .
walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ;" and , in short , her look and manner declared , that go she would not .
The carriage is gone to - day , to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to - morrow .
But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr . Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street .
I shall be no support to Mrs . Weston .
He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence .
" Oh !
Elinor had just been congratulating herself , in the midst of her perplexity , that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter , it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth , when her visitor entered , to force her upon this greatest exertion of all .
The Colonel , though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship , warmly admired the screens , as he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood ; and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited , they were handed round for general inspection .
Mr . Suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove , and whose father had it before him -- I believe , at least -- I am almost sure that old Mr . Suckling had completed the purchase before his death ."
Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful , as far as Anne ' s observation reached .
I happened to be at Lyme ."
Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth : but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal , that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand ; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her .
" Such an extraordinary dream of mine !"
how those little fingers of yours fly about !"
Neither the dissipations of the past -- and she had lived very much in the world -- nor the restrictions of the present , neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits .
" He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose .
Mr . Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself .
Mr . Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother ."
There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities .-- No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly ."
Her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma ' s eyes -- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do .
Mrs . Weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise .
The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties .
" What is the matter , sir ?-- Did you speak to me ?"
The character of his manner was embarrassment .
It was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged , nor too speedily made use of ; and the visit to Lady Middleton , which had not before had any precise limits , was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days ' time .
" The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where ."
I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm .
Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals , and thus by a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise , gained her own end , and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time .
Elinor was soon called to the card - table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on HER side would have given , for self - interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary .
He continued at the window ; and after calmly and politely saying , " I hope the little boy is better ," was silent .
Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion .
Weston ."
HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland .
CHAPTER X
Miss Dashwood -- a subject such as this -- untouched for fourteen years -- it is dangerous to handle it at all !
" He has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand .
On the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days .
She had no doubt of what Mr . Weston was often thinking about .
It had formerly been Charlotte ' s , and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance , in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect .
Elinor advised her to lie down again , and for a moment she did so ; but no attitude could give her ease ; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another , till growing more and more hysterical , her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all , and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance .
Elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose , or Marianne consent , to enter the house while Mrs . Smith was in it , with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance .
" I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn , instead of coming here ."
This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties .
There was no denying that those brothers had penetration .
I have not seen him since seven o ' clock .
Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr . Suckling , in income .-- However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax .-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation .
Without that attraction , not all her money would have tempted Elliot , and Sir Walter was , moreover , assured of her having been a very fine woman .
I have no thoughts of matrimony at present ."
He is thought to be gouty ."
cried Emma ; " at that rate , what will become of her ?"
The same manners , however , which recommended Mrs . John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs . Jennings , and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud - looking woman of uncordial address , who met her husband ' s sisters without any affection , and almost without having anything to say to them ; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street , she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence .
" Thank you .
It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses ."
In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton ' s first letter to Norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs . Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey .
She thought well of Frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest .
Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again .
To give up one ' s child !
It was a very awkward moment ; and the countenance of each shewed that it was so .
The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them , was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime , because , had any suspicion of it occurred to the others , proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage ; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy ' s engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled , than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family .-- He thus continued :
Elinor was grateful for the attention , but it could not alter her design ; and their mother ' s concurrence being readily gained , every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be ;-- and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton .
I might have sold it again , the next day , for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker ' s hands , I must have sold out to very great loss ."
She would not take a denial .
" I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed to say that , thank God !
" But you are always kind ."
Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced .
why cannot I speak to him ?"
so long ago as the 7th of November , ( as I am going to read to you ,) and has never been well since .
" They walked , I conclude .
It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever .
What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish , but judged from the motion of her lips , that she did not think THAT any material objection ;-- and Mrs . Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest .
Every body is so surprized ; and every body says the same obliging things .
" Thank you .
Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion , regular features , and a remarkably pretty figure .
Elinor scolded him , harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves , for having spent so much time with them at Norland , when he must have felt his own inconstancy .
" It first came into my head ," replied Mrs Smith , " upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way .
Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was .
" You were speaking ," said he , gravely .
Anne understood it .
She was their earliest visitor in their settled life ; and Captain Wentworth , by putting her in the way of recovering her husband ' s property in the West Indies , by writing for her , acting for her , and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend , fully requited the services which she had rendered , or ever meant to render , to his wife .
The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable .-- It was a wretched business indeed !-- Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for !-- Such a development of every thing most unwelcome !-- Such a blow for Harriet !-- that was the worst of all .
His marriage must still be a distant good ;-- at least , I am afraid it cannot take place very soon .--"
" To confess the truth ," said Mrs Smith , assuming her usual air of cheerfulness , " that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have .
do the children grow ?
and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody -- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr . Knightley ?
" I have not been working uninterruptedly ," he replied , " I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe .
Books of engravings , drawers of medals , cameos , corals , shells , and every other family collection within his cabinets , had been prepared for his old friend , to while away the morning ; and the kindness had perfectly answered .
" I am disappointed ," was his only answer .
a word to the wise .-- I am in a fine flow of spirits , an ' t I ?
No !
Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which , as she now began to feel , her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby , had contributed to place her ;-- and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor .
Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness ; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive .
" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did ."
He imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief .
" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement ," said she , " nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you ;-- but as that was not the case "--
It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating .
She was on the point of sending again for Mr . Harris , or if HE could not come , for some other advice , when the former -- but not till after five o ' clock -- arrived .
Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment ."
" He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived ," repeated Sir John .
" For shame !
He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for Mr . Elton .
Perfectly remember Mrs . Perry ' s coming .-- Extraordinary dream , indeed !"
I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us .
Whatever the truth of it might be , and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it , yet while she saw Marianne in spirits , she could not be very uncomfortable herself .
Walk home !-- you are prettily shod for walking home , I dare say .
He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter ."
when a gallant young man , like Mr . Frank Churchill ," said Mr . Knightley dryly , " writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best ."
" Yes ; Jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining .
She could not speak another word .-- Her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer .
Elinor then heard Willoughby say , in a low voice to Marianne , " There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure .
The agony of grief which overpowered them at first , was voluntarily renewed , was sought for , was created again and again .
Oh !
They had not been long seated and composed when Mr . Woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter ' s attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last .
The most unaccountable business !
This , however , was a profound secret , not to be breathed beyond their own circle .
What is all this ?"
The remaining five were now to draw their cards .
But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once .
No doubt it had been from jealousy .-- In Jane ' s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed .
She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her .
This had been a proof of life , however , of service to her sister ; and Henrietta , though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with Louisa , was kept , by the agitation of hope and fear , from a return of her own insensibility .
Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs . Jennings , and beginning a journey to London under her protection , and as her guest , without wondering at her own situation , so short had their acquaintance with that lady been , so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition , and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before !
And as to the house being a bad one , I do not know what the Colonel would be at , for it is as good a one as ever I saw ."
Wherever they went , she was evidently always on the watch .
They will be delighted to come to - morrow evening .
I have heard so much in praise of Mr . Frank Churchill .-- At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others .
The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other .
It was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision .
The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .
Well , I was persuaded there were two .
" Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert ."
Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations .
he talks of you ," cried Charles , " in such terms --" Mary interrupted him .
" No more it is ."
and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him ."
Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both ."
There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject .
She could not endure its noise .
Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me ."
Mr . Perry did say so .
She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and that even when days were fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even chance that Mrs . Churchill were not in health and spirits for going ; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person ; and that , though he had his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , without considerable address _at_ _times_ , that he could get away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night .
Richard ?-- Oh !
Can it be woman ?
One meeting was unavoidable ."
It had not been necessary , and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from .
We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead .
A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight , was exactly what suited her mind .
And when I think of Benwick , my tongue is tied ."
CHAPTER 32
" And cannot you call me ` George ' now ?"
" I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me .
Her father -- and Harriet .
Your father might have asked us to dinner , I think , if he had wanted to see us .
He began by speaking of the concert gravely , more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross ; owned himself disappointed , had expected singing ; and in short , must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over .
No indeed I am not ."
This was too much .
You may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for ."
` If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir .'
The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax ; and there she had no doubt .
Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall , presiding and directing with a self - possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was .
His father would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare .
Elinor , who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration , without feeling at all nearer decision than at first , heard this ; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing , resolution must do all , soon found herself leading to the fact .
Their sisters and Mrs . Jennings were invited likewise , and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon , who , always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were , received his eager civilities with some surprise , but much more pleasure .
On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others .
" Oh !
I know we agreed never to name him -- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person .
I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me .
This is saying very plainly --` Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you .
She consulted , and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter .
She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say --
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , smiling , " you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again .
there were very different thoughts to succeed .
" You will not ask me what is the point of envy .-- You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity .-- You are wise -- but _I_ cannot be wise .
" Oh !
They were three days on their journey , and Marianne ' s behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs . Jennings might be expected to be .
When the ladies withdrew to the drawing - room after dinner , this poverty was particularly evident , for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some variety -- the variety of politics , inclosing land , and breaking horses -- but then it was all over ; and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in , which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood , and Lady Middleton ' s second son William , who were nearly of the same age .
" Mary M ---.
Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently - improved views , of fresh - formed happiness , which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all ; and Mrs Musgrove ' s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress .
She begged him to think again on the subject .
Mrs . John Dashwood wished it likewise ; but in the mean while , till one of these superior blessings could be attained , it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche .
He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act .
His profession qualified him , his disposition lead him , to talk ; and " That was in the year six ;" " That happened before I went to sea in the year six ," occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together : and though his voice did not falter , and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke , Anne felt the utter impossibility , from her knowledge of his mind , that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself .
While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in .
Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits , as her friend Anne ' s was in the warmth of her heart .
" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship ."
Elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of Highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match .
That his repentance of misconduct , which thus brought its own punishment , was sincere , need not be doubted ;-- nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy , and of Marianne with regret .
They went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of " Men ' s Beavers " and " York Tan " were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said --" But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ .
" Oh !
I was the last man who commanded her .
Depend upon it , whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now , as a young man he had not the smallest value for it .
said Mrs . Jennings , " that is HER revenge .
To me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other ."
" I do not understand what you mean by ` success ,'" said Mr . Knightley .
Excuse me , Miss Dashwood .
It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London .
I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time .
But what can be the matter ?-- Is she really not ill ?"
Were she your equal in situation -- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case .
" As for regret ," said Marianne , " I have done with that , as far as HE is concerned .
This charade !-- If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it ."
He hesitated , got up , walked to a window .
That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment .
" No !"
For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me .-- Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post .-- What was to be done ?-- One thing only .-- I must speak to my uncle .
" There is no necessity for my calling this morning ," said the young man ; " another day would do as well ; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which --"
Their party was small , and the hours passed quietly away .
" Not I , indeed .
" You had better explore to Donwell ," replied Mr . Knightley .
" He trifles here ," said he , " as to the temptation .
--
" My idea of good company , Mr Elliot , is the company of clever , well - informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what I call good company ."
All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed .
have you met him to --"
" Yes ," continued Elinor , gathering more resolution , as some of the worst was over , " Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed -- for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you -- a concern which I am sure Marianne , myself , and all your friends , must share ; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character , and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion ."
Quite a surprize to me !
I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased , but it is now a confirmed feeling .
On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence ; and he told them that Mr . Willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , " Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills .
Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say :
We really are so shocked !
" Oh !
With their wealth , their views increased ; their want of a larger house , their inclination for more company .
" Yes ; he was not married when I knew him first ."
But this conciliation was not granted ; for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor , and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne , no effect was produced , but a look of indifference from the former , or of disgust in the latter .
" You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken .
A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line .
Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma ; but her words , every body ' s words , were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates , who came in talking , and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire .
The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it -- so much consideration for her father .
" What was I talking of ?"
" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps ," replied Emma , smiling --" but , excuse me , it must be thought of ."
Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the last half - hour of an evening which Mr . Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls , was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject .
After one of the many praises of the day , which were continually bursting forth , Captain Wentworth added : --
CHAPTER 37
The young ladies went , and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her .
" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him ."
" Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend .
The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr . Weston ' s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear .
It depends entirely upon his aunt ' s spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper .
I am quite of your opinion , Mrs Croft ," was Mrs Musgrove ' s hearty answer .
" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act .
She assured him that she had not .
Two thousand a year without debt or drawback -- except the little love - child , indeed ; aye , I had forgot her ; but she may be ' prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ?
" A very fine young man indeed , Mr . Weston .
He is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that I know of .
She will break it to you better than I can .
" It will be natural for me ," he added shortly afterwards , " to speak my opinion aloud as I read .
The card - table was then placed , and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park .
very little , Nothing that I regard ."
" Infirmity !"
.
" I am monstrous glad of it .
I have engaged Mrs . Weston to correspond with me .
Elinor , Elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like -- may resist insult , or return mortification -- but I cannot .
What answer did you give him ?-- Did you allow him to hope ?"
In the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit ; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice , she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet , as they walked away ,
The weather added what it could of gloom .
What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other !
and yet , she could not help rather anticipating something decisive .
Marianne ' s was finished in a very few minutes ; in length it could be no more than a note ; it was then folded up , sealed , and directed with eager rapidity .
At that moment she first perceived him , and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight , she would have moved towards him instantly , had not her sister caught hold of her .
When he was again in their company , he could not help remembering what he had seen ; nor could he avoid observations which , unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight ,
They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it .
But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn .
" That will never be , however , I can assure you .
" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs . Weston ' s letters .
His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before .
Mr . Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation .
She could do little more than listen patiently , soften every grievance , and excuse each to the other ; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours , and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister ' s benefit .
Mr . Churchill , oh !
Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith , which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard - hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her .
They could go there again with them in the autumn .
Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs . Goddard ' s ; Mr . Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth .
You can send for us , you know , at a moment ' s notice , if anything is the matter ; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you .
How I catch myself out !
my dear Fanny ; her life cannot be worth half that purchase ."
Anne did not share these feelings .
You will have no business here .-- Let it stay , however ,' said she ; ` give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back .
But , upon my word , Mr . Elton , in your case , I should certainly excuse myself .
The treachery , or the folly , of my cousin ' s maid betrayed us .
I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way .
Don ' t let them make YOU unhappy ."
" Emma knows I never flatter her ," said Mr . Knightley , " but I meant no reflection on any body .
You can ' t think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether .
She was , of course , the object of their joint dislike .-- When they had nothing else to say , it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse ; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet .
" Your sister ' s marriage ."
Her situation should secure your compassion .
" A fortnight !"
" If he would only have done as well by himself ," said John Dashwood , " as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing .
Do let me hear a word about the expense of it ."
with a heart pierced , wounded , almost broken !
has he written to you ?"
" Yes ,-- I left London this morning at eight o ' clock , and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough ."
But I think , my dear , you said you had got it ."
The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley , and of dear , good Dr Shirley ' s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to Louisa , but had been almost everything to Henrietta .
Lucky fellow to get anything so soon , with no more interest than his ."
Ah !
" Oh , did not you ?
He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining - room -- hated sitting long -- was always the first to move when he could -- that his father , Mr . Knightley , Mr . Cox , and Mr . Cole , were left very busy over parish business -- that as long as he had staid , however , it had been pleasant enough , as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike , sensible men ; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether -- thought it so abundant in agreeable families -- that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much .
Elton , before she could be spoken to , was ready ; and before Mr . Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining - parlour , was saying --
" When I see him again ," said Elinor to herself , as the door shut him out , " I shall see him the husband of Lucy ."
A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly ."
" And now ," silently conjectured Elinor , " she will write to Combe by this day ' s post ."
She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer .
My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
" So very obliging of you !-- No rain at all .
she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again ," eagerly rejoined Mrs . Elton .
By reading only six hours a - day , I shall gain in the course of a twelve - month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want ."
A speedy cure must not be hoped , but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted .
He stopped .
How mortifying to feel that it was so !
His air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing .
my love , I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself .
Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply ,
Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other , but from the very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration -- but without solicitation , or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting to assist and befriend her .-- Before Emma had forfeited her confidence , and about the third time of their meeting , she heard all Mrs . Elton ' s knight - errantry on the subject .--
That there was to be such a party had been long generally known : it had even given the idea of another .
He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said ,
The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle ; but after a while she could do no more .
His letters disgust me ."
I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper ."
Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give .
" Walter ," cried Charles Hayter , " why do you not do as you are bid ?
The impertinence of the Eltons , which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening , had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions ; and she looked forward to another happy result -- the cure of Harriet ' s infatuation .-- From Harriet ' s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom , she had strong hopes .
" I meant ," said Elinor , taking up some work from the table , " to inquire for Mrs . EDWARD Ferrars ."
Emma was quite at a loss .
The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book , in spite of Marianne ' s declaration that the day would be lastingly fair , and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills ; and the two girls set off together .
" Yes ," sighed Anne , " we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them !"
Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice .
I should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend ."
Charles , you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday .
" Certainly ," said Elinor ; " he seems very agreeable ."
But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life ."
It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M . P .-- But do you know , he says , he will never frank for me ?
An hour ' s complete leisure for such reflections as these , on a dark November day , a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows , was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell ' s carriage exceedingly welcome ; and yet , though desirous to be gone , she could not quit the Mansion House , or look an adieu to the Cottage , with its black , dripping and comfortless veranda , or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village , without a saddened heart .
Ah !
" Yes , dear ma ' am ," said Mrs Croft , " or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long .
But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders ."
Fortune I do not want ; employment I do not want ; consequence I do not want : I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband ' s house as I am of Hartfield ; and never , never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man ' s eyes as I am in my father ' s ."
The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin ' s calling at Mrs . Goddard ' s a few days afterwards .
Do not we rather surpass your expectations ?
They can do nothing satisfactorily without you ."
Very well ; I shall not attempt to deny Emma ' s being pretty ."
She began to think that be must be in liquor ;-- the strangeness of such a visit , and of such manners , seemed no otherwise intelligible ; and with this impression she immediately rose , saying ,
yes -- but how they were conveyed hither ?-- the manner of their coming ?"
She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject , she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter , of a possible attachment on his side , of the desirableness of the alliance , supposing such attachment to be real and returned .
In feeling , in action , in condition , in every thing ."
I love to look at her ; and I will add this praise , that I do not think her personally vain .
There is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing .
" If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax ' s .-- Of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their ' s , nor the world ' s law .'"
The following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married .
The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself , poor Harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from .
Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected .
But have I ever known it ?-- Well may it be doubted ; for , had I really loved , could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice ?-- or , what is more , could I have sacrificed hers ?-- But I have done it .
His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet ' s manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment .
She was sure of a pleasant reception ; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming , seemed hardly to have expected her , though it had been an appointment .
" Did Mrs . Ferrars look well ?"
How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness !
Mrs Charles quite swears by her , I know ; but I just give you this hint , that you may be upon the watch ; because , if you see anything amiss , you need not be afraid of mentioning it ."
A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related .
It seemed at first an accidental division , but it never materially varied .
` Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ` And waste its fragrance on the desert air .'
Are you going near Camden Place ?
Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby ,
" Very well .
-- which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly alarmed at .
" I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself .
It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done , as to their general situation .
She is not the superior young woman which Emma ' s friend ought to be .
She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .
it shews what a sad invalid I am !
" And had you a great many smart beaux there ?
James could take the note .
He answered rather hesitatingly , " Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different .
These were her reasons -- she had no better .
" No , I fancy not ," replied Mrs . Elton , with a most satisfied smile ."
As soon as Mrs . Dashwood had recovered herself , to see Marianne was her first desire ; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child , rendered dearer to her than ever by absence , unhappiness , and danger .
" Why do you not ask Marianne at once ," said she , " whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ?
Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude .
He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure .
To me , who live so much alone , her conversation , I assure you , is a treat ."
" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls ," when the door was thrown open , and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room .
Miss Bates looked about her , so happily !--
I wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady .
" Indeed you wrong me ," replied Lucy , with great solemnity ; " I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you ,' I should resolve upon doing it immediately ."
The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall .
.
Not a puncture , not a weak spot anywhere .
" It is Frank and Miss Fairfax ," said Mrs . Weston .
" This was really his ," said Harriet .--" Do not you remember one morning ?-- no , I dare say you do not .
I was breakfasting at the Ellisons ,-- and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings .
" Ay , my dear , I ' ll warrant you we do .
And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the lover .
Mrs . Churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without him ; she had been in a very suffering state ( so said her husband ) when writing to her nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but now she was too ill to trifle , and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay .
I could not answer it .
" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ?
He had handed them both in , and placed himself between them ; and in this manner , under these circumstances , full of astonishment and emotion to Anne , she quitted Lyme .
She was not doomed , however , to be long in ignorance of his measures .
How could she have been so brutal , so cruel to Miss Bates !
In that , he could not be defended ; but if he had injured her , how much more had he injured himself ; if her case were pitiable , his was hopeless .
.
" I will leave you ," said Elinor , " if you will go to bed ."
They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year .
He was very unkind to his first wife .
" Oh !
I told you that your suspicions would guide mine ."
Sir John , who called on them more than once , brought home such accounts of the favour they were in , as must be universally striking .
" Oh !
What Miss Anne says , is very true ," was Mr Shepherd ' s rejoinder , and " Oh !
She thinks so little of her own beauty .
" Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , I shall take Emma ' s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour .
The answer was , " Oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing .
You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell ' s account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr . Elton and Miss Hawkins ."
I am quite ready .
She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing - room , by asking her whether she did not like Mr . Palmer excessively .
Sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness .-- Miss Taylor married .
" I have known it these four months .
She must wait a moment , or he would think her mad .
" Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ' s fate to marry the woman who loves him best .
Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before , or an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and before their first conversation was over , she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins , which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy .
the best nature in the world -- a wedding ."
Marianne ' s lips quivered , and she repeated the word " Selfish ?"
but dear Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away .-- Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end !
" When I got to Donwell ," said he , " Knightley could not be found .
That is , I know you must have seen her a hundred times -- but are you acquainted ?"
Mr . Elton certainly did not very well know what to say .
She was quite easy on that head , and consequently full of strength and courage , till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft ' s suddenly saying ,--
The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it .
He has those to please who must be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices .
A little beauty , and a few smiles , and a few compliments to the navy , and I am a lost man .
Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself .
Too good , too excellent creature !
It is not an employment to which they have been brought up .
" Oh , dear , that is a great pity !
Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises ."
She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business ; felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man , as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate ' s being married .
You and I need not be afraid .
" And I do envy him , Emma .
Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain .
But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward .
She moved away and sat down .
She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston .
This delay on the Colonel ' s side , however , did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least , for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards , and moving different ways , Mrs . Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say , and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said ,
Miss Hamilton , now Mrs Smith , had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable .
The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door -- of her doubt -- her dread -- perhaps her despair !-- and of what SHE had to tell !-- with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm .
He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room .
" Have you indeed no idea ?"
He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied .
Elinor sat down to her drawing - table as soon as he was out of the house , busily employed herself the whole day , neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name , appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family , and if , by this conduct , she did not lessen her own grief , it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase , and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account .
She managed the recital , as she hoped , with address ; prepared her anxious listener with caution ; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology ; did justice to his repentance , and softened only his protestations of present regard .
Her narration was clear and simple ; and though it could not be given without emotion , it was not accompanied by violent agitation , nor impetuous grief .-- THAT belonged rather to the hearer , for Marianne listened with horror , and cried excessively .
To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing ."
He will have her at last ; aye , that he will .
Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs . Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs . Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon .-- Mr . Weston and Mrs . Elton led the way , Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed .
" The Crown !"
" Well ," said she at last , trying to recover herself ; " this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day , before I can at all comprehend it .
You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself .-- No description can describe her .
Their intercourse was painful enough by letter .
We have notice of it in a letter to - day .
Poor Mr . Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming , and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride .-- Could he have seen the heart , he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either , he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr . Perry , and talked on with much self - contentment , totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return .
" To think of your sending us all your store apples .
I do not expect my children to be asked , you know .
" Now ," said Harriet , " you _must_ recollect ."
We are always meeting with some old friend or other ; the streets full of them every morning ; sure to have plenty of chat ; and then we get away from them all , and shut ourselves in our lodgings , and draw in our chairs , and are snug as if we were at Kellynch , ay , or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal .
But whether I should write this apology , or deliver it in person , was a point of long debate .
And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love ."
Has he a house at Allenham ?"
It is remarkable , that Emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded .
They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction , with her handkerchief at her eyes ; and without noticing them ran up stairs .
Captain Wentworth must be out of sight .
I wish Hetty had not gone .
God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover .-- But you understand me .-- Yes , you see , you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can .
Yet , though smiling within herself at the mistake , she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it .
You must have heard every thing to be sure .
Thus a circumstance occurred , while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast , which sunk the heart of Mrs . Jennings still lower in her estimation ; because , through her own weakness , it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself , though Mrs . Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill .
Emma could not help laughing as she answered , " Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do .-- But , Mr . Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him .
But I ought to have gone before .
was all her answer ; but the accent was decisive enough .
It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose ."
But her death , which happened ten years before his own , produced a great alteration in his home ; for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr . Henry Dashwood , the legal inheritor of the Norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it .
Anne had done ; glad that it was over , and not absolutely hopeless of doing good .
" This explains it .
" Do not boast of it , however ," said Elinor , " for it is injustice in both of you .
His disapprobation was expressed , but apparently very little regarded .
--
I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves .
And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed !
" I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr . Palmer ' s , where I have been dining ."
were the first words which burst from Captain Wentworth , in a tone of despair , and as if all his own strength were gone .
Respect for right conduct is felt by every body .
Surely you must be mistaken .
But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men ."
Hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ` the best education in the world ,' know nothing worth attending to .
" It must be a severe trial to them all .
Mr Elliot was in Bath .
That is your date .
Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ?"
" If we could be certain that it would be only for a while !
Well , it don ' t signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him .
Mrs . Jennings , though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier , was satisfied with the compromise ; and Elinor , as she swallowed the chief of it , reflected , that though its effects on a colicky gout were , at present , of little importance to her , its healing powers , on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister .
That is _ship_ ;-- plain as it can be .-- Now for the cream .
I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs . Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother ' s anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs . Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr . Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us .-- Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs . Jennings won ' t think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ' twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her .-- My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne ,
It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh !
It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits .
A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne , and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery - maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long - petted Master Harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa .
Alas !
It will be all to one a better match for your sister .
She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it .
He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world !
Lord !
Do not mistake me , however .
It is a most uncommon complexion , with her dark eye - lashes and hair -- a most distinguishing complexion !
Her second duty now , inferior only to her father ' s claims , was to promote Harriet ' s comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making .
" Oh !
" I cannot agree with you there ," said Elinor .
no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea .
But Sir John could not prevail .
And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting .
Leave little Charles to my care .
I will give you my authority : his friend Colonel Wallis ."
my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months !
Woman ' s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now ; or with no important variation .
And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live .
She was well paid for her impudence .
Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness .
" Only give me a hearing .
You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us .
" I have ," returned Elinor , colouring likewise , and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him , " I have heard it all .
I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may .
These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here ; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage .
Mr . Perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr . Woodhouse ' s life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately .
First , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man ' s youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man .
Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it , for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention , made neither objection nor remark , attempted no vindication of Willoughby , and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible .
I cannot conceive a situation more deplorable .
In another moment , however , she found herself in the state of being released from him ; some one was taking him from her , though he had bent down her head so much , that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck , and he was resolutely borne away , before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it .
Another song , however , was soon begged for .
It was a commission to me !
But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared .
It cannot be long , I think , before she comes ."
My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him .
The carriage was sent for them now .
CHAPTER 47
To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you !
" What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ?"
He is always with them ; half lives in the family , I believe .
" Miss Fairfax ' s compliments and thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise ."
He certainly knew what was right , nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed ; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct .
" But I thought you would .
And touching Miss Bates , who at that moment passed near --" Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ?
I knew you would wish it .
Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove ."
He stopped .-- Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs . Weston , and did not herself know what to think .
They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since Henrietta ' s coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and Louisa , just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable .
They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation .
" Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady , that it would be high treason to call it in question ; but I am sure , without exaggeration , that her upper house - maid and laundry - maid , instead of being in their business , are gadding about the village , all day long .
But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct .
When I first became intimate in your family , I had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire , more pleasantly than I had ever done before .
Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is ."
Only think of their coming so suddenly !
Thank you , thank you .
" Well , you will soon be better now ," replied Anne , cheerfully .
Emma could not resist .
She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out .
said he .
He certainly might have heard Mr . Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr . Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr . Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives .
Every body last night said how well you played ."
They vindicated him against the base aspersion .
But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps ."
Anne , judging from her own temperament , would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves , which Louisa ' s illness must have so greatly shaken .
When there , at her own particular request , for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother , Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her .
I never saw such fine children in my life .-- I declare I quite doat upon them already , and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children ."
" No , I do not think we shall ."
Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing , that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure , an acquisition of wealth to her brother , by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished .
" I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill - bred ."
You are forced on exertion .
How can you be so unjust ?
" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse .
This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr . Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it .
But here comes a friend , Captain Brigden ; I shall only say , ` How d ' ye do ?'
She had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence .
The situation of the house was good .
As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit .
He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me .
But Emma , in her own mind , determined that he _did_ know what he was talking about , and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life , and to marry , from worthy motives .
and A .-- Em - ma .-- Do you understand ?"
" Ah , well !
We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell ' s doing , that she did not .
" I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- I never dine with any body ."
He had been blamable , highly blamable , in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be .
-- But this note made me know myself better .
" Months !"
How do you like it ?-- Selina ' s choice -- handsome , I think , but I do not know whether it is not over - trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over - trimmed -- quite a horror of finery .
You make the most of it , I know ," cried Louisa , " but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place .
She turned her eyes towards his face , and found him with some surprise to be her brother .
" I hope not _that_ .-- It is not likely .
replied Miss Bates .
she is a sweet creature !
I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress .
" I see what a life I am to lead among you .
I do indeed .
Even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane ."
Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can .
" Certainly ," he replied , with a sneer --" I came into Devonshire with no other view ."
While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin ' s visit .
" You know ," said she , " I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta ; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made , she has no right to throw herself away .
The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion .
Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word " advertise ," but never dared approach it again .
" Good God !"
" I hope I shall remember , in future ," said Lady Russell , as soon as they were reseated in the carriage , " not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays ."
The confession completely renewed her first shame -- and the sight of Harriet ' s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again .
She returned it almost instantly , acknowledging the likeness .
Thank you , we do indeed .
What would you advise me to do ?
" I hope he will be here to - morrow , for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence .
Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain , when I make up my accounts in the spring , I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you .
" It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected .
We have it from Frederick himself .
You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _some_ ,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her .-- This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will ,-- I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now ."
Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St . Mark ' s Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room .
May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ?"
One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland .
brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking , of private understanding even , between Frank Churchill and Jane .
" Conjecture -- aye , sometimes one conjectures right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong .
She repeated it to Edward .
But what a thing here is , by way of a boat !
Mr . Woodhouse could never allow for Mr . Knightley ' s claims on his brother , or any body ' s claims on Isabella , except his own .
Elinor , who did justice to Mrs . Jennings ' s kindness , though its effusions were often distressing , and sometimes almost ridiculous , made her those acknowledgments , and returned her those civilities , which her sister could not make or return for herself .
Mr . Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr . Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat .
To some of the best - looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned , for , though partially revived , she was quite helpless ; and in this manner , Anne walking by her side , and Charles attending to his wife , they set forward , treading back with feelings unutterable , the ground , which so lately , so very lately , and so light of heart , they had passed along .
He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill - timed conversation .
" I thank you , ma ' am , sincerely thank you ," said Marianne , with warmth : " your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it .
I must get rid of every thing .-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven !
I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest ."
It was overpowering happiness .
what a boat it is !"
Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly .
If you know it already , as surely you must , I may be spared ."
" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case ," replied Emma ; " but am disposed to side with you , Mr . Weston .
" I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way ," said Lucy , eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke ; " but perhaps there may be reasons -- I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent ."
It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw , and does Lucy ' s head and heart great credit ."
She wanted more vigorous measures , a more complete reformation , a quicker release from debt , a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity .
Every thing was explained to him by Mrs . Dashwood , and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr . Ferrars , since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor .
Anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but " he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before ," & c . & c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then .
Mr . John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour .
Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax .
It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing .
He must be starved , you know ;-- that is certain ; absolutely starved ."
But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her , and on Mrs . Jenning ' s entrance , escaped with the precious card .
He has a most excellent mother .
One day ' s delay will not be very material ; and till I have written to Mr . Ferrars , I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else .
There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother - in - law was interesting .
Poor man !
" Where could you possibly hear it , Mr . Knightley ?
There being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about Charles , she could not shake him off .
Had you married , you must have been always poor .
They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment ."
She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected .-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name .-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible .-- No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , " Beg her to walk up ;"-- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging .
" The name of Anne Elliot ," said he , " has long had an interesting sound to me .
You have made yourself too clear .
We must allow for the effect of shade , you know ."
But on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied .
A very successful visit :-- I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint .
" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living ' s being enough to allow them to marry ."
Mr . Knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other .
" You must begin your improvements on this house ," observed Elinor , " and your difficulties will soon vanish ."
She did not really like her .
And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine !
Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ; and Marianne ' s accident being related to him , he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham .
Is this true ?
Harriet had business at Ford ' s .-- Emma thought it most prudent to go with her .
THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient , and how small was the consolation , beyond the consciousness of doing right , that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune .
The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background .
-- ` I can see nobody ,' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were .
I will call another day , and hear the pianoforte ."
" Well ," said he , " we have brought you some strangers .
I have been to the theatre , and secured a box for to - morrow night .
" Oh !
They will be so near their own stable ."
Now Mary , I declare it was so , I heard it myself , and you were in the other room .
When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to - day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance !"
" For my own part ," said he , " I am excessively fond of a cottage ; there is always so much comfort , so much elegance about them .
He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir - presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject .
You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies -- quite a horror of them .
They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs . and Miss Bates .
And so much was said in this way , that Anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy , and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once .
Mrs . Weston -- it is too calm a censure .
When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs . Weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with ,
The time now approached for Lady Russell ' s return : the day was even fixed ; and Anne , being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled , was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch , and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it .
Don ' t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman ."
" _You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions .-- I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution .-- I wish I had attended to it -- but --( with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness ."
Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments , which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man , and she regarded him with respect and compassion .
The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine .
She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man ;-- or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .
so far off !-- and the air so bad !"
But it should be so no more .
There was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly .
" It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly ."
" Me !"
" My advice ," said Mrs . Weston kindly and persuasively , " I certainly do feel tempted to give .
It was a look , however , very well bestowed , for it relieved her own feelings , and gave no intelligence to him .
Happy those , who can remain at Highbury !"
" Yes ," said Emma , " I hope I do ."
" No engagement !"
Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner , he was talking to Miss Fairfax .
" My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me ."
He will suffer enough in them ."
The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother ' s ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs . Elton ' s activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will .
When the time proposed drew near , Mrs . Weston ' s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse .
" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it .
This decision checked Mary ' s eagerness , and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance .
My dear Mrs . Weston , do not take to match - making .
I wish I may not sink into ` poor Emma ' with him at once .-- His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther ."
Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask ."
Nobody could be so imprudent !
Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so ; but it was not immediately in her power .
They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within , and by themselves , and Anne had the kindest welcome from each .
It was necessary to the happiness of both ; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour , they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments , unconnected with such as society produced , within a very narrow compass .
Jane did not look round .
I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light .
Mr . Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more .
His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice ; and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts , when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with .
" Christmas weather ," observed Mr . Elton .
" I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny ," said he , as he walked back with his sister .
Oh !
With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued :
He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return .
She was soon undressed and in bed , and as she seemed desirous of being alone , her sister then left her , and while she waited the return of Mrs . Jennings , had leisure enough for thinking over the past .
Mr Hayter had some property of his own , but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove ' s ; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country , the young Hayters would , from their parents ' inferior , retired , and unpolished way of living , and their own defective education , have been hardly in any class at all , but for their connexion with Uppercross , this eldest son of course excepted , who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman , and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest .
She only wished that it were less openly shewn ; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self - command to Marianne .
They met for the sake of eating , drinking , and laughing together , playing at cards , or consequences , or any other game that was sufficiently noisy .
And it cannot be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ?
Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin ?
Though heavy and feverish , with a pain in her limbs , and a cough , and a sore throat , a good night ' s rest was to cure her entirely ; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her , when she went to bed , to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies .
We never could agree in our choice of a profession .
She went to Mrs . Goddard ' s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was .-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred -- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks .
Good Mrs . Stokes would not know her own room again .
how eloquent , at least , were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment , and a cheerful confidence in futurity , against that over - anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence !
When he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind .
Anne sighed and blushed and smiled , in pity and disdain , either at her friend or herself .
That Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but Sir Walter ' s continuing in singleness requires explanation .
But the usual fate of Anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on .
" One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do ," replied Mrs . Weston .
" Invited !"
The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex .
She saw no reason against their being happy .
" No , I cannot think that .
No , I thank you , I have nothing to trouble you with ."
yes , very .
" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject ," replied Emma , smiling ; " but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?"
" Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you , Anne , though he was so attentive to me .
They set off .
My dear Jane , are you sure you did not wet your feet ?-- It was but a drop or two , but I am so afraid :-- but Mr . Frank Churchill was so extremely -- and there was a mat to step upon -- I shall never forget his extreme politeness .-- Oh !
The two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body .
It will be the only difference ."
" Ah !
She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his .-- They had reached the house .
Talks of his being going on so well !
Willoughby ."
said he , turning his eyes towards Jane .
" My protege , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me .
My visits to Mrs . Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth ."
Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind .
They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister .
" Dear Ma ' am ," replied Elinor , smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended , " how good you are !
Mine , I confess , are exhausted .
Not a syllable passed aloud .
" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me ," said Emma , " and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself .
no , my love ; but you will soon be tired .
She need not trouble herself to pity him .
Elton ?"
What instances must pass before them of ardent , disinterested , self - denying attachment , of heroism , fortitude , patience , resignation : of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most .
His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet ' s inclination .
" One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _she_ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her ."
" And who was this uncle ?
They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme , as a public place , might offer .
" I honour his sincerity .
She laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart .
They are quite different creatures with you !
Mr Elliot had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased .
Elinor ' s lips had moved with her mother ' s , and , when the moment of action was over , she wished that she had shaken hands with him too .
" Only think !
The less worthy females were to come in the evening , with Miss Bates , Miss Fairfax , and Miss Smith ; but already , at dinner , they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general ; and , while politics and Mr . Elton were talked over , Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour .
So we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things ."
She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr . Weston ' s good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense .
Marianne ' s preserver , as Margaret , with more elegance than precision , styled Willoughby , called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries .
" Impossible !-- I never can call you any thing but ` Mr .
said he quietly , and looking at her ; " of what nature ?"
Anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival , but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for .
This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute .
said Lucy , as they walked up the stairs together -- for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs . Jennings , that they all followed the servant at the same time --" There is nobody here but you , that can feel for me .-- I declare I can hardly stand .
we shall certainly take that post ."
The box was brought and placed before her , and Mrs Smith , sighing over it as she unlocked it , said --
I beg your pardon .
What immediately followed is known .
Captain Wentworth left his seat , and walked to the fire - place ; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards , and taking a station , with less bare - faced design , by Anne .
" Have you heard from her yourself this morning ?"
Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on , and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation .
" We allowed unnecessary room .
To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her .
It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands .
Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs . Bragge ' s is the one I would most wish to see you in ."
Selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly .
Mr . Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago ."
What Anne first heard was --
However , I don ' t think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr . Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night ."
.
Emma denied none of it aloud , and agreed to none of it in private .
Emma ' s project of forgetting Mr . Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her .
In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge ."
The character of Mrs . Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed .
Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it .
