    Pre_process() (partially started in Jessie's code)
        (taken from instruction file as base)
        # step 1: read in the data from the file as a chunk of text
        # step 2: convert the text into a list of sentences, stripping
        #newline characters (\n)
        # step 3: represent each sentence as a list of tokens
        # step 4: insert start and stop tokens
        # step 5: return the list of lists

    n-gram_prob()
        (incorporate laplace smoothing. <UNK>ing here + sentence_prob? or in pre-process with train() + score() selection.
